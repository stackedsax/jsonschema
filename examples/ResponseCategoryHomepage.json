				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eOn April 16, Rosneft and ExxonMobil moved forward on their agreement made last summer to cooperate in developing the energy resources of the Russian continental shelf. Representatives of the oil majors signed several agreements, including one on the establishment of two joint ventures for work on the Black and Kara seas and on the purchase by Rosneft of shares in three Exxon projects in North America. Because work on the shelf requires considerable investment, Rosneft invited other major oil companies, both Russian and foreign, to participate in joint development of 12 blocks.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eDeputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, who is the administration official in charge of Russia&#8217;s energy development, said that according to preliminary estimates, at least 15 offshore platforms will be built for the deposits in the Kara Sea alone. &#8220;The resource base allows us to hope for success, but its costs will be high, because the working conditions are difficult,&#8221; Sechin said. The preliminary assessment for the Kara Sea project is $200-300 billion, and for the Black Sea, about $55 billion. Drilling of the first exploratory wells in both the Kara and Black Seas is scheduled for 2015.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003ePrime Minister and President-elect Vladimir Putin, who was present at the signing, expressed confidence that the cooperation between Rosneft and ExxonMobil will last for decades. \"I expect ... that the initial projects will be large-scale,\" he said. Rex Tillerson, President and Chairman of the Board of ExxonMobil, said that the agreements reached will help the company expand its presence and work in the Black and Kara seas while ensuring Rosneft\u0027s presence in the U.S., Canadian, and other markets. According to the agreements, a subsidiary of Rosneft is acquiring a 30 percent stake in ExxonMobil\u0027s La Escalara project in the Delaware Basin in West Texas.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe Russian company also won the right to acquire 30 percent of 20 blocks owned by ExxonMobil in the western Gulf of Mexico. Another subsidiary of Rosneft will take 30 percent of ExxonMobil\u0027s stake in the Harmattan acreage of the Cardium formation in the Canadian province of Alberta, which are unconventional gas reserves. According to Sechin, these projects are already underway, and negotiations are now proceeding about the price of the Russian company\u0027s participation. He did not say anything more specific about the timing of completion of the transactions. The parties also agreed on joint development of technologies for extraction of difficult-to-recover oil reserves from the Achimov and Tyumen formations in the Prirazlomnoye, Mamontov, and Priobskoye fields in Western Siberia. In the future they will begin to discuss joint projects to develop difficult-to-recover reserves in this region. ExxonMobil also signed two memoranda of understanding with Rosneft and other major Russian companies, on proposed cooperation for infrastructure development projects in the energy sector. These refer particularly to orders for equipment, supplies, and joint construction of working facilities.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eOther players\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eRosneft sent a proposal for joint development of 12 blocks of the shelf to the main private players in the Russian oil industry &#8211; Lukoil, TNK-BP, Surgutneftegaz, and Bashneft. Eduard Khudainatov, the head of Rosneft, reported that similar letters were sent to some foreign companies, but he did not provide details. The proposal included blocks in the \"gray zone\" near the Norwegian shelf and blocks on the Magadan shelf. Responding to a question about what resources the 12 blocks contain, Khudainatov said, \"We are offering the best and the richest.\" He specified that cooperation presupposes financing of the work by the Russian companies.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eA representative of Bashneft said that the company acknowledges receipt of the letter, and its leadership has already begun to study the proposal. According to Khudainatov, the conditions proposed are similar to those between Rosneft and ExxonMobil &#8211; a 30 percent share. The offer was made on Putin\u0027s instructions, after a meeting on the development of the shelf last week, Khudainatov added. The Prime Minister said at that time, that for the most difficult projects in the Arctic, the tax on extraction of minerals could be only about 5 percent of the selling price of the products. Additionally, a proposal is making the rounds that would eliminated the property tax and VAT for imported equipment needed for all new projects, regardless of difficulty. These conditions would remain in force for 15 years after the start of commercial production. New projects on the Russian shelf will also be exempted from export duties. Sechin said that the order on preferential taxation of projects on the Russian shelf has already been signed, which, in his view, makes such projects effective. Meanwhile only companies that are more than 50 percent state-owned and have at least five years of experience on the shelf have the right to develop the shelf of the Russian Federation. In fact, only two public companies, Gazprom and Rosneft, may work on the shelf.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirst published in Russian  RIA Novosti.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eOn April 17, the recently merged MICEX-RTS exchange hosted a conference in New York called &#8220;Russia Is Not About Bears&#8221; for funds and individual investors. The event aimed to increase pool of market participants and give an update on advancement in the exchange since the merger. In December 2011, Russia&#8217;s two largest stock exchanges, MICEX and RTS merged into one exchange, giving investors in Russia a one-stop-shop for trading equities, bonds, derivatives, and currencies.  The exchanges had developed separately for almost two decades and their merger is one of the steps in Moscow&#8217;s ambitious plan to become an international financial center. The combined exchange has an estimated value of $4.5 billion and company has reported to be planning an IPO in 2013.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eMICEX-RTS President Ruben Aganbegyan said that one of the focus areas for the exchange is liberalizing the security issuance procedures and improving the market for companies to IPO in Russia. Aganbegyan said that MICEX-RTS is working close with local legislators to harmonize procedures in Russia with the international best practices. &#8220;The rules are so strict and inflexible,&#8221; Aganbegyan said, explaining that Russia needs to move beyond just following rigid regulations when it comes to the listings rule. &#8220;We are trying to get the country to move as quickly as possible to the globally acceptable principals of corporate governance and information disclosure to all its investors, especially the most liquid once.&#8221; While reforming the legislation will take time, MICEX-RTS is considering the example of Brazilian exchange &#8220;Novo Mercado,&#8221; which issued its own set of rules that companies can adopt voluntarily in addition to the ones required by law in order for companies to be listed in the new segment of the exchange.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eMICEX-RTS plans this year to attract multinational companies that have operations in Russia to issue debt on the Russian exchange in rubbles. &#8220;We see first stage is to attract companies that have business or investment base in Russia. We are not competing for the global listings, we are fighting for the ones that are in Russia, so they will not go abroad,&#8221; Aganbegyan said. He said that MICEX-RTS is talking to several big international companies right now and plans to have them on board by the end of the year, but the names were not disclosed. Last year MICEX-RTS has signed an agreement on cooperation with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to strengthen corporate governance in Russia. Aganbegyan said that through this partnership, the OECD has brought a lot of experience and best practices from other emerging markets.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eCooking schools have taken off in Moscow with more and more Muscovites opting for an evening spent kneading, basting and beating as an alternative to dinner and a movie. For some it&#8217;s a new and interesting way to go out and meet people, and for others the courses are a good hunting ground for finding a life partner. But regardless of the motivation of the participants, the number of classes has not caught up with demand, so the market is virtually competition free.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003e&#8220;The market for cooking courses cooled down during the financial crisis. This business really flourished around 2003-2005, when cooking schools were popping up all over the place. But the crisis seemed to kill off nearly all the competition. There are still a few courses where the lady of the house will teach you the correct way to boil up a pot of semolina or peel a potato, and then there are also professional training colleges; so my school is really the only one of its kind,&#8221; said Pavel Rogozhin, owner of the Pro.stranstvo cookery school. Rogozhin has modeled his business on European cooking schools, where haute cuisine dishes are prepared in a slick, highly disciplined environment, under the direction of a well-respected master chef.  &#8220;All my courses have strict rules about behavior: no small-talk, no chatting on your mobile phone. As soon as a client enters my school, he or she will be given ingredients, utensils and instructions, and then they&#8217;ll busy themselves by a kitchen worktop for four hours at a time. People come to me to work and to learn &#8211; anyone who wants to mess around and socialize shouldn&#8217;t bother signing up. This is a school, not a club.&#8221; The strict rules mean that this particular school attracts a certain type of client; according to Rogozhin his school is generally frequented by wealthy people over the age of 35, who come here to learn to cook delicious, sophisticated food for themselves and for their families. Many of them have taken cooking classes in Europe and are looking for a similar experience in Russia. And the menu is tailored to this type of client. As a rule they, learn to make recipes involving seafood, expensive cuts of meat, intricate sauces and desserts with exotic ingredients. Rogozhin made a conscious decision not to concentrate on the cuisine of any particular country. &#8220;People don&#8217;t want to limit themselves to just Spanish or Italian cuisine. The main request I get from my clients is to show them how to make good home-cooked food &#8211; recipes you can do at home that don&#8217;t require too many special skills,&#8221; Rogozhin said. Although Rogozhin is working at the top end of the market, he doesn&#8217;t consider his business a success: &#8220;In Moscow the average price for one lesson is between 100 and 200 Euros. But this price is the same as it was in 2005! We need to put the cost of one lesson up to around the 300 Euro mark in order to stay in the black. But this would kill the business &#8211; psychologically people aren&#8217;t prepared to go above a certain price. And 200 Euros is just about the maximum we can charge.&#8221; To keep his business going, Rogozhin has had to negotiate with sponsors, and it turns out that producers of home-appliances and kitchenware are only too happy to provide their support. The deal is that the school can use their products free of charge on condition that the companies&#8217; logos are prominently displayed. Another way to cut the running costs of the business is to make contracts directly with alcohol and meat suppliers (who also tend to be more flexible in pricing). This allows the school to avoid buying ingredients in supermarkets at the normal retail price. &#8220;If we can agree on price reductions this is a huge plus for the business,&#8221; Rogozhin said. &#8220;Food costs eat into between 30 and 50 percent of our income. Another 50 percent goes to rent. So our only way of making money is to save on alcohol and ingredients.&#8221; And of course it&#8217;s also important to attract as many clients as possible. According to Rogozhin, his school hosts up to 20 events each month &#8211; master-classes for groups of 4-5 students, as well as corporate evening events. The school sometimes gets so busy that he needs to hold courses in two shifts &#8211; morning and evening. However this influx of business only really happens around the winter holidays when there is a big demand for office party venues, on top of lessons for private clients. But Rogozhin says it&#8217;s not often that his company is so rushed, than generally his type of business does not generate a constant stream of custom.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eGastro bar\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eA constant influx of people, lively parties and massive crowds is more the scene of another well-known player in this market &#8211; the gastro bar Akademiya Del Gusto. This school opened its doors in 2008, just when the credit crunch took hold, and it became the first of its kind. According to the business&#8217;s customer relations manager, Evgenia Belkina, Akademiya&#8217;s philosophy is all about having fun: &#8220;We host all kinds of different events; master-classes, office parties, and team-building. The thing they have in common is a relaxed convivial atmosphere: people come to us to taste the spirit of Italy, drink wine, cook up a delicious meal and then eat it, and gain huge pleasure and satisfaction from the whole experience.&#8221; For 5,500 rubles (150 Euros), taking part in an event at Akademiya Del Gusto does not come cheap, but nevertheless, it is not easy to get into a course &#8211; some of the seminars have waiting lists of more than 5-6 weeks. Belkina will be the first to admit that her business does not revolve around private clients &#8211; their main source of income comes from contracts with companies: among Del Gusto&#8217;s main clients are an international fizzy drinks manufacturer, several European fashion houses and a few big Russian companies. &#8220;Our busiest time is probably around the build-up to New Year,&#8221; Belkina said. &#8220;In December 2011, for example, we didn&#8217;t have a single day off &#8211; we hosted more than 30 events.&#8221; The success of the business is clear by its location: Del Gusto rents a 300 square meter building on Tverskaya Streets, sometimes known as Moscow&#8217;s Fifth Avenue. Belkina claims that Del Gusto does not have to worry about competition. &#8220;Now Yulia Vysotskaya [an actress, wife of the director Anton Konchalovsky] has opened her own school, and maybe she&#8217;ll manage to shake up the market a bit. But at the moment there&#8217;s no competition at all,&#8221; Belkina said. Neither Belkina nor Rogozhin are able to explain why this is; in Moscow there are apparently no bureaucratic hurdles to deter people from entering this industry: for registration purposes cookery schools are categorized as caterers, on a par with cafes and restaurants, and they need only to conform to the same health and safety standards. Only Rogozhin was able to come up with one possible reason for the lack of competition on this market: &#8220;Banks won&#8217;t lend to someone wishing to set up a cooking school because this business is so unpredictable &#8211; with sharp bursts of activity over the winter months and a very uneventful summer. No bank is going to give money to an organization with a business plan like this. So it&#8217;s only possible to open a school using your own personal savings.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLike bread and butter\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eBut there is another way to cash in on Muscovites&#8217; growing interest in European cuisine, and this one avoids the risk of financial ruin: Eager to get their slice of the cooking-school pie, many restaurants have now started to offer cooking courses taught by the cooks and chefs who work in them. Today more than 20 eating establishments in Moscow offer customers lessons in how to cook for themselves, and, unlike the market for independent cooking schools, the choice of formats, dishes, and prices are very varied: ranging from courses costing 500 rubles (15 Euros) where budding chefs learn how to make their own pelmeni and fry up an omelette, to serious sushi-making courses for children costing 150 Euros. &#8220;These courses are great for boosting a restaurant&#8217;s image: the owners can open their doors and invite the customers in, let them look around the kitchen, get to know the chefs, see for themselves how clean and tidy everything is and what sumptuous ingredients go into the meals they eat. It&#8217;s not so much a money-making venture, as an opportunity to show the clients how much you care about them,&#8221; said Tatiana Potochnikova, founder of the Cooking Men courses at the Sisters Grimm restaurant. Potochnikova&#8217;s course is one of the most popular in Moscow, and has long been a business in its own right - much more than a mere attachment to the restaurant. &#8220;Exactly a year ago we decided to hold courses just for men. We never dreamed it would take off like this. It was March, the time of year when everyone starts spending time at their dachas, and we decided to teach the stronger sex how to master the art of barbequing, and the best way to choose meat for making shashlyk [Russian kebabs].&#8221; The course was well-promoted and well-priced (coming in lower than the average market rate at 50 Euros) and this is what guaranteed the project&#8217;s success. And the restaurant has profited, too. According to Potochnikova, not only does the cooking school bring in a tidy income on its own, it has also substantiated the turnover of the restaurant itself &#8211; as soon as the master-classes went on offer there was a marked increase in consumer traffic. Potochnikova believes the custom will keep coming: &#8220;I think our project is just at the beginning of its journey &#8211; I think it will remain popular for at least another year. It&#8217;s hard to say what the next stage will be: the mood in Moscow changes very quickly, and in this city you have to constantly adapt, change, and think up new ideas to stay ahead of the game&#8221;.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe Russian market for online shopping is both the youngest and most dynamic in Europe. It began to develop only four years ago, but by 2011 had outpaced France and Germany in terms of unique visitors. Russians are now embracing online shopping despite horror stories of fraud among early adapters. \"We know that the time between when someone logs on for the first time on the Internet and when they make their first purchase is several years. We believe 2012 will become that year for a huge number of Russian Internet users. We expect explosive growth in the market,\" said Svetlana Sorokina, organizer of the Online Retail Russia Congress. This year alone more than 30 traditional brick-and-mortar stores plan to open online versions. According to Sorokina, the most anticipated opening of the year is the X5 Retail Group\u0027s online store. Representatives of online retailers estimated market turnover for goods purchased online in 2011 to be 270 billion rubles ($9 billion), up from 240 billion ($8 billion) in 2010). According to Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC), in the coming years, market volume for online purchase in Russia will more than double.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eTraditional retail growth in Russia is much slower: about 5-7 percent per year. But for the time being, the share of online sales as a percentage of total turnover of retail sales in Russia is negligible: 1.6 percent. This is much lower than in other major European countries; in the UK, for example, it is more than 10 percent. Only in Moscow, where the share of Web sales is around 20 percent, does volume approach the global average. More and more though, large retail chains operating in Russia recognize that online stores are a full-fledged opportunity for sales. For example, last year the share of online sales for the Euroset mobile phone retailer increased from 1.5 percent to almost 5 percent. For individual product groups, a company\u0027s share of sales over the Internet can reach up to 15 percent. Representatives of Euroset believe that over the course of five years, the share of Internet sales will reach 20 percent. M-Video, one of Russia\u0027s largest sellers of electronics and home appliances, reported that online sales in 2011 increased by 90 percent. The company expects that by 2015 online shopping will be responsible for up to a quarter of revenues.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAccording to studies done by OZON, one of the largest online retailers in Russia, the most popular products on the RuNet are clothing (25 percent), electronics (15 percent), books (15 percent), cosmetics (13 percent), products for children (9 percent) and music and movies (8 percent).\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe rapidly growing Russian market has already begun to attract the attention of major international companies. Ebay, Amazon, and Alibaba have shown interest in the Russian market. Groupon Russia announced that it intends in the second half of the spring to launch an online store that will operate under the \"discounter\" format and feature \"products ranging from household appliances and consumer electronics to clothing and shoes.\" At the moment, discount service Biglion.ru has this market segment almost to itself. During its first month of operation, Biglion sold 40,000 items, ranging from clothing and footwear to household appliances and electronics to tours.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"Title": "Russian bonds model the supply and demand concept",
				"Author": "Ben Aris",
				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eOn March 29, Russia returned to the international capital markets with a $7 billion Eurobond issue that was more than three times oversubscribed. This sale was only the second since the Kremlin suspended debt issuances following the 1998 crisis. It followed a sale of domestic Russian bonds at the beginning of February, which was more than five times oversubscribed, with up to 80 percent of the demand coming from overseas, according to bond traders. In that sale, demand was so high that the Russian Ministry of Finance more than doubled the offering to 35 billion rubles ($1.1 billion). The success of this latest sale only reinforces Russia&#8217;s claim to be the most attractive debt market in the world. With more than $500 billion of reserves in the bank, Russia can cover its external debt dollar-for-dollar with cash. However, the solidity of Russia&#8217;s financial position is not reflected in the yields. While most developed markets have slashed interest rates to a few percent at best, the Russian sovereign yield of 5.67 percent on the longest version of the latest bond, which matures in 2042, is very attractive. The relatively low yield was key, as the government&#8217;s bond will be used as a benchmark against which to measure prices for a flood of corporate bonds that are expected to follow. &#8220;[The yield was] very important for us because these investors guide others interested in investing,&#8221; Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on the day of the issue. &#8220;Russia had very good success, and that will manifest itself in the borrowings of other state-run companies, including infrastructure ones.&#8221; The yields on the domestically traded Ministry of Finance bonds, known as O.F.Z.s, are even more appealing, as they carry the highest yields of all major emerging markets. Demand for the O.F.Z. has soared since the start of the year, when foreign investors were given direct access to the domestic Russian bond market following reforms that went into effect in February. The yields of 8 percent in ruble terms and 15 percent in dollar terms led to these bonds being snapped up by foreign investors. &#8220;Even though true liberalization hasn&#8217;t happened yet, you can see the effects on the market. Some foreign investors are already accessing O.F.Z.s, and local traders and investors are speculating ahead of the expected full liberalization,&#8221; said Dmitry Yakushin, a fixed-income trader at Renaissance Capital in Moscow.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe further reforms that will give foreign traders full access to Russia&#8217;s buoyant domestic debt market still have a few more hurdles to cross, but the goal is for Russia&#8217;s Micex exchange to be hooked up to Euroclear, the main European trading platform, this summer. This will make it possible for foreign traders to buy and sell Russian issues without ever leaving their desks. &#8220;Previously, foreign investors seeking Russian sovereign exposure required local broking accounts at Micex, and they needed local custody accounts. This could take months and even years to complete,&#8221; said Martin Gregson, a spokesman for Euroclear. &#8220;That has now changed &#8212; the bonds can be bought [over the counter], and a Micex account is no longer required. This will allow many offshore investors access, and we think even more will gain access once O.F.Z.s are able to be settled through international depositaries, like Euroclear.&#8221; Reforms and Russia&#8217;s solid fundamentals are only two factors driving the booming bond market. The reluctance of domestic banks to lend to Russian companies along with the state&#8217;s policy to push borrowers to borrow at home rather than abroad are both adding to the impetus. The state is looking for more ways to raise money in anticipation of the increased government spending in the near future necessary to carry out many of President-elect Vladimir Putin&#8217;s campaign promises. Moscow hopes to borrow a page from Washington&#8217;s strategy book and finance government spending through increased borrowing in its own currency. Heavy spending by the state means that the surpluses the government enjoyed in the last decade could soon become a thing of the past. The efforts by the Ministry of Finance to create an efficient debt market are part of a drive to finance the expected budget deficits. Russia plans a net issuance of 1.2 trillion rubles ($41 million) in 2012, larger than the programmed 1.5 percent of G.D.P. deficit, making Russia the fastest-growing local debt market among emerging economies, according to Morgan Stanley.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eMoscow&#8217;s first American diner was shipped to Russia in parts, much like a recycled amusement park ride. Muscovites lining up in the snow outside the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall noticed one day that a diner was appearing piece by piece, like a stamped-tin and chrome Lego fortress, right in the heart of Moscow. It is hard to describe the buzz the Starlite Diner caused when it opened its doors in the mid-1990s. Today, it still draws a cult of devotees with its bacon grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken pot pies and other American novelty foods that predate the term &#8220;bad cholesterol.&#8221; It took four weeks to teach the menu to the first wave of Russian waitresses, who wore uniforms straight out of the TV show &#8220;Happy Days.&#8221; Suddenly, business deals were being consummated over French fries and ketchup. As expatriate families arrived in Moscow, the restaurant became their first stop after Red Square. Those were heady days for international relations between the West and Russia, and American expats were streaming in &#8212; from brigades of consultants and businessmen, to herds of journalists and academics, as well as missionaries, students, poets and dreamers. Moscow attracted adventurous people who were taken by its energy. Shawn McKenna, one of the founders of Starlite Diner and other restaurants in Moscow, was among the first of these pioneers, and also among the longest lasting. &#8220;I like the vibe and trendiness of the city, the economic development of the entire population, and that it is a melting pot of different nations and regional cultures of Russia,&#8221; McKenna said. In his earliest visits to Russia, he identified a niche. McKenna experienced the sometimes amusing, always frustrating lack of good service in restaurants in the 1990s. &#8220;One time our delegation drove to a Georgian restaurant on Tverskaya, which turned to be closed for guests due a lunch break of their employees,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s when I realized how much opportunity lies here.&#8221; By the mid-1990s, he had started his own restaurant business, bringing the classic diner experience to Moscow. Initially, 95 percent of his clientele was made up of expatriates. Today, Starlite Diner serves authentic burgers and milkshakes to mostly Russian customers. The diner concept also attracted young Russians on a budget. While Moscow gradually grew into one of the expensive cities in the world, McKenna&#8217;s restaurant cultivated the Russian middle class with the idea that something could be trendy and cheap at the same time. Said McKenna, &#8220;Focusing on Russians brings the success in the long term.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRecommended by Expats\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eShawn McKenna spends a lot of time in his own restaurant when he&#8217;s in Moscow, but still has a soft spot for the famous Izmailovo Vernisage souvenir market on the outskirts of Russia&#8217;s capital, which sells everything from old Samovars to DVDs and is home to the city&#8217;s Vodka Museum. &#8220;When family and friends come, you have to descend to the class of tourists,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I love the Izmailovo market, the whole experience of bargaining like in the old days in the epicenter of the flea-market society of Moscow, surrounded by this entrepreneurial spirit.&#8221; Chris Lee, President of C.B.S.D. Thunderbird Russia, agreed:&#8220;In addition to the kebab you can find at Izmailovo, Moscow has a wealth of foreign cuisine you won&#8217;t find in the States. Georgian food is something most Americans have never encountered, but that everybody loves. I personally recommend Tiflisky Dvor on Ostorzhenka Street.&#8221; To get away from the city&#8217;s notorious traffic, Lee recommended night driving. &#8220;The lighting and architecture of Moscow are an amazing combination. We go up to the Sparrow Hills and Moscow State University to get a view of the city. Christ the Savior Cathedral is one of my favorite places to take guests at night. We&#8217;re a middle-aged couple with kids, so no night clubbing!&#8221; Karl Swanson of Natura Foods was on the train to Moscow&#8217;s Domodedovo airport to pick up relatives visiting for the first time when he said,&#8220;I want to give the kids a sample of typical Russian culture. The Pushkin Museum is nice, but maybe a little early for them. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re visiting the Moscow State Puppet Theater and the Moscow Nikulin Circus &#8212; they&#8217;ll be absorbed in a Russian story and surrounded by a Russian audience.&#8221; American journalist Alec Luhn in fascinated by Moscow&#8217;s history. &#8220;The best place to get in contact with Soviet architecture and ideology is VDNKh [the All-Union Exhibition Center, a park with pavilions showing the agricultural achievements of the Soviet republics] and the Sovetskiye Vremena [Soviet Times] restaurant. I like going to VDNKh because it&#8217;s a place steeped in history,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Today, the Soviet Union seems strange and archaic, but at one point its ideology completely defined the lives of millions of people, even dictating the way the buildings around them looked. VDNKh creates a physical connection with that world and helps you feel it in a more visceral way, and it&#8217;s authentic &#8212; not some theme-park recreation.&#8221; Eric Leroy, a longtime English teacher in Moscow, appreciates the city&#8217;s inhabitants. In an interview with Afisha magazine, he said, &#8220;Moscow&#8217;s charm is in its people. I love Russians. I had so many questions before coming here, and everyone told me life in Russia would not be easy. But the opposite turned out to be true: I came here and immediately felt at home. There&#8217;s some mixture of coldness and rudeness with warmth and spontaneity here that I really love, and with my Russian wife, I&#8217;m at home here.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe Far Eastern Russian city of Blagoveshchensk witnessed a fireworks display the night after Vladimir Putin was elected President in March. But the fireworks didn&#8217;t come from Russia &#8211; they were launched on the south bank of the Amur River, which separates Blagoveshchensk from the Chinese city of Heihe. Chinese authorities decided to celebrate the electoral victory of Putin, whose time in power, both as president and prime minister, has overseen a five-fold increase in bilateral trade over the last decade to $70 billion (this number is predicted to his $200 billion by 2020). Few places in the world offer quite as sharp contrast between European and Asian civilizations as the five-minute bus ride across the frozen Amur, which during a short summer can be traversed by hydrofoil. And contacts between Russians and Chinese living are becoming more frequent because of a visa-free travel for local tour groups. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to rest and buy some stuff,&#8221; exclaimed Valery, a tall, burly and boisterous 40-something Blagoveshchensk native as he eagerly boarded the bus to make the journey across the Amur. Heihe boasts shopping malls, saunas, restaurants, dentists&#8217; offices and teashops, all offering their wares in Russian to cater to visiting tourists with rapidly growing incomes. Even the street signs are bilingual. Not everyone is happy with the boom on the Chinese side. &#8220;They used to have a small village over there with huts and dirt roads,&#8221; recalled Nikolai Kukharenko, lifetime Blagoveshchensk resident and head of the local Confucius Institute (a Beijing-based NGO that promotes Chinese language and culture at academic institutions around the world). &#8220;Now there are more skyscrapers on that side than here. A lot of locals are concerned that they&#8217;ve advanced economically at our expense.&#8221; Local papers abound with near-daily stories of Chinese poachers being caught smuggling everything from protected timber to rare tiger pelts. The vast majority of the burgeoning trade between the two neighbors is raw material exported from Russia and manufactured goods imported from China. The nature of the economic relationship is symbolized by the East-Siberian-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline, which ships Russian crude oil to fuel China&#8217;s factories. An enduring wariness about China&#8217;s success has led many locals to lament that increasing numbers of young people in Russia&#8217;s border regions see their academic and professional future depending on China and other neighboring countries. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s our usual Russian paranoia,&#8221; said Kukharenko. &#8220;It&#8217;s true there&#8217;s a growing interest among the younger generation in learning foreign languages, including Chinese, but this is true of almost every country. Students here want to study abroad and broaden their horizons through foreign cultures just like everywhere else. I can count only a few who want to move abroad permanently,&#8221; he explained. Yet this suspicion has led to economic and political obstacles for the several thousand Chinese citizens permanently residing in Russia. Dima (name changed) is an owner of several Chinese restaurants in Blagoveshchensk in his late 20s. &#8220;I&#8217;m not allowed to own this property because I&#8217;m not a Russian citizen,&#8221; he explained in heavily accented Russian. &#8220;The owners and authorities know that and take advantage. They&#8217;ll arbitrarily raise rent and evict me if I don&#8217;t agree.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eOffer the Chinese Europe and the Dinosaurs\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eSome Russian officials have begun to think about how they can change the economic relationship. Igor Gorevoy, the recently appointed Economy Minister for the Amur Region, said he would like to start attracting Chinese consumer spending as well as their cheap consumer goods. &#8220;The way I see it, there&#8217;s no way we&#8217;ll be able to out-manufacture the Chinese,&#8221; he explained over tea in his posh office in downtown Blagoveshchensk. &#8220;Their products are cheaper and better. We have to look at our competitive advantage, and offer them the one thing they can&#8217;t produce.&#8221; Gorevoy&#8217;s plan is to attract some of the 100 million-plus potential tourists with rapidly rising incomes who live just across the river. &#8220;Actually many of the ideas came to us from a Hong Kong businessman visiting Blagoveshchensk,&#8221; recalled Gorevoy. &#8220;He said convincing some international giants to build hotels here should be relatively easy, and the tourists will flock.&#8221; Gorevoy&#8217;s vision is based on the notion that the Chinese see Russians as a European people and are eager to &#8220;visit Europe&#8221; when it&#8217;s so close. &#8220;If we set up a few Eiffel Tower mock-ups, a Big Ben and some basic infrastructure for a leisurely family vacation, they&#8217;ll be eager to visit,&#8221; he explained. Gorevoy hopes that a boom in tourism and service industry jobs will keep young people in Blagoveshchensk. He has spent much of his first six months in office obtaining permits for commercial construction along the border. Development in border areas is sensitive and controlled in Moscow because it can be a matter of national security. But the first signs of progress are already evident. Cranes and trucks now dot the Russian side of the Amur as Gorevoy&#8217;s &#8220;Golden Mile&#8221; of Ferris wheels and hotels begins to take shape.  The minister is discussing the possibility of a pedestrian bridge or aerial lift across the Amur. Blagoveshchensk is also famous for having some of the world&#8217;s best-preserved dinosaur remains, and by 2015 the Amur Region will host Russia&#8217;s main spaceport, which is currently under construction. Exclaimed Gorevoy: &#8220;It&#8217;s our Cape Canaveral. This is world class stuff.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDinosaur Cemetery\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eDinosaur remains were first discovered on the right bank of the Amur river in the early 20th century. In 1911, some excavated skeletons were taken to St. Petersburg and put on display at the Museum of the All-Union Geological Institute. For many years after that excavations ceased, until a Russian-Belgian team returned to the site in 1999 to discover the complete skeleton of a platypus mammoth (10 meters in length). Since then the area has been designated a federal monument as several more unique species have been unearthed.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003e&#8220;The Russian venture capital market is rather small,&#8221; said Alexander Lupachev, chief Investment officer at Skolkovo, &#8220;We are interested in investors with experience and a successful track-record.&#8221; Last week at the Global Technology Symposium in Silicon Valley, the Skolkovo Foundation signed a memorandum of understanding with one of the longest-running U.S. venture capital firms, Bessemer Venture Partners, which will inject $20 million into the project over the next several years. The Skolkovo Foundation provides grants and mentorship programs, and connects entrepreneurs in Russia with more than 30 venture capital funds, ten of which are international. With its venture capital partners, the Skolkovo Foundation has invested around $40 million in 40 projects. The agreement with its partners is to invest more than $350 million during next three years. &#8220;I view this partnership with Skolkovo as an opportunity for us to really find our way to some of the best start-ups in Russia,&#8221; said David Cowan, a partner with Bessemer. &#8220;We are like the paparazzi of entrepreneurship, we always want to be looking where the action is and now we see it happening in Russia in a big way.&#8221; Cowan said that Bessemer invests actively in Brazil, India, Israel and some parts of Europe. The Skolkovo Foundation is looking to acquire more partners from U.S. and European venture capital funds, as well as attracting Asian investors. Together with Russian Venture Company and Rusnano Skolkovo, it will bring a group of venture capital investors from Asia to begin negotiations in Russia. Lupachev said that a majority of the success stories at Skolkovo come from the IT sector, but the foundation is planning to enter other sectors such as biotech and green technologies. Partnering with Skolkovo, international venture capital funds get access to pre-selected start-ups in Russia as well as a local partner who can oversee the projects. Some groups such as $100 million DFJ-Aurora Fund have also opened up offices in Russia. DFJ-VTB Aurora is a joint partnership of DFJ Network and Russian investment banking group VTB, which has offices in Silicon Valley and Moscow. &#8220;We want to use those famous Russian scientists that everybody knows exist but nobody knows how to commercialize,&#8221; said Alexandra Johnson, managing director of Moscow-based DFJ-VTB Aurora Fund. &#8220;We are long term investors and we are willing to work with entrepreneurs as they progress.&#8221; Johnson said that some of the companies they invest in have teams of Russian engineers but work in Silicon Valley if the product is more suitable for the American market. Other venture capital firms are actively talking to Russian companies, including seed fund 500 Startups, which runs a $29 million fund for emerging and early-stage companies. &#8220;There is a lot of engineering talents in Russia,&#8221; said Dave McClure, a founding partner of 500 Startups, &#8220;I definitely became aware of the size of the domestic market in Russia.&#8221; McClure visited Russia twice in the fall of 2011 and is planning to start investing in Russian companies within the next year. 500 Startups already invests outside of the United States in some Eastern European countries as well as in Brazil, India and China. A new Skolkovo resident is Zingaya, a company with a software development team in Russia. The company provides a web-based alternative to toll-free numbers. Zingaya has more than 100 clients, mainly in Russia, but this year it started its U.S.-based operations. Just last year, the company got its first investment of more than $1 million from Russian investor Esther Dyson. Dyson is an angel investor who has been putting capital into Russian start-ups for the past several years and is on the board of the Russian search engine Yandex, which went public last May. &#8220;There is a lot of capital in Russia, many times companies think they need to go abroad, but they are wrong,&#8221; Dyson said. &#8220;What is hard to find in Russia are experienced managers.&#8221; Dyson said that Russia doesn&#8217;t have the kind of managerial talent that has grown a business from start-up to mid-size enterprise.  American venture capital firms can offer the advice and management support that not all Russian investors can offer, she said. &#8220;It is not easy to find money, but I think people focus too much on money and not on the management,&#8221; continued Dyson. &#8220;It is a tough market for Americans. There is a lot of competition and it is even tougher if you are a Russian coming to the U.S. market.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"Author": "Pavel Koshkin",
				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRussia is among the top 50 countries with favorable investment climates, according to the recent &#8220;Bloomberg Best Countries for Business&#8221; ranking, which measured conditions for attracting more foreign investment. Russia is in 48th place in the Bloomberg ranking, out of 160 countries analyzed. It pushed ahead of its BRICS colleagues India and Brazil, which took 49th and 50th place, respectively. The survey took into account numerous economic indicators, from the degree of economic integration and the cost of setting up a new business, to the cost of labor and materials and the readiness of local consumers. Business analysts expressed cautious optimism about regarding the report, which targets portfolio investors who are looking to maximize profits. Some international business observers said that a renewed commitment to Western business practices, stable incomes and low inflation all contributed to Russia&#8217;s improved status. &#8220;Improving the investment climate in the country is a gradual process and it may take several years,&#8221; said Fedor Naumov, head of the research at the Moscow-based Kapital Asset Management  LCC. &#8220;Nevertheless, there are some positive signs for improvements. Russian banks and some companies pledged to follow Western standards of doing business,&#8221; he said. Yet the Bloomberg ranking is also controversial, since the 2011 World Bank report has Russia in 120th place in its report. Some analysts appeared hesitant to rely on the accuracy of the Bloomberg ratings considering such discrepancies. Bloomberg and the World Bank rankings are not easily comparable because they utilized different criteria and different methodologies, according to Yevgeny Gavrilienkov, chief economist at investment firm Troika Dialog in Moscow. &#8220;While the World Bank has a more complicated, complex approach in creating ratings, Bloomberg doesn&#8217;t have [the same] methodology. They just target portfolio investors,&#8221; he said.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRussia&#8217;s post-WTO economy\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eWhile the Bloomberg ranking is encouraging to some, companies that are doing business or considering business ties with Russia are also waiting for the results of the country&#8217;s WTO accession to kick in. &#8220;In the short-term we won&#8217;t see any noticeable results from the accession to WTO as was the case with Ukraine which joined the WTO recently,&#8221; said Gavrilienkov. In the long term, the investment climate may be improved. However there are hardly likely to be radical changes.&#8221; The Bloomberg ranking could well encourage new investors to take the plunge into the Russian market and take advantage of stable incomes and the low level of inflation in 2011. &#8220;Russia has a comparably big income per capita thanks to the well-developed oil industry,&#8221; Naumov said. &#8220;Investors may take it into consideration because the more income people have, the easier for investors to promote certain production. In addition, foreign companies may take into consideration the forecasts of Russia&#8217;s future economic growth.&#8221; Bernard Sucher, a member of the Board of Directors at Aton Group, said that foreign entrepreneurs have been investing in Russia despite the lack of favorable business conditions.  &#8220;Russia\u0027s shortcomings may be serious, but they have not stopped thousands of companies, domestic and international, from building strong and profitable businesses over the past two decades,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The evidence of one\u0027s own eyes says that Russia doesn\u0027t belong at the bottom of any global ranking assessing investment climate or opportunity.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eWhile most offline and online purchases made in Russia are still paid in cash, contactless payment experiments have been flourishing in several Russian cities over the last two years. Last October, Megafon, another leading operator, also launched NFC payments in the St. Petersburg subway, in addition to using the system for loyalty programs with several local banks and retailers. Back in 2010, MTS, a competitor of Vimpelcom and Megafon, introduced contactless payment in Lukoil petrol stations in Perm, as well as in the Moscow subway. Their version of NFC technology will be deployed in the public transportation systems of &#8220;a range of cities across the country,&#8221; MTS announced this week. In October of last year, MTS demonstrated a prototype of the &#8216;Store of the Future&#8217; at the RusNanotech-2011 forum in Moscow. By bringing their phones within 10 cm, or about 4 inches, of a payment terminal, customers could make an instant payment using their bank or mobile account. For a charge of more than 1,000 rubles, or approx. $32, the buyer had to enter a PIN  on the terminal. The experiment was based on SIM cards supporting PayPass, a payment feature from MasterCard, with which MTS signed a partnership agreement that same month. Meanwhile, the operator&#8217;s own bank, MTS Bank, announced it will issue a new generation of bank cards, branded as &#8216;MTS Dengi,&#8217; also supporting PayPass. In the MTS retail outlets, which will be equipped with NFC readers, customers will be able to make contactless payments using their bank cards or their mobile phone accounts. Last November, the global semiconductor manufacturer NXP was reported to be prepared to produce NFC tags in the production facilities of Mikron, a leading Russian semiconductor manufacturer located in Zelenograd, a city in the Moscow region. An notable player on the Russian NFC scene, Ambiq Tech St. Petersburg, the Russian branch of the US company Ambiq Technologies, produces mobile phone add-ons for the local market. The insert allows customers to use their phone as a discount card or a payment instrument linked to their bank account. NFC &#8211; an acronym for Near Field Communication &#8211; was created 10 years ago. The technology has been widely discussed since Google introduced its Google Wallet last year. Global payment companies are actively working on projects using this technology.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirst published in East-West Digital News.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRussia\u0027s President Dmitry Medvedev took further steps on Monday to improve the country\u0027s business climate as he strives to leave a legacy of lasting change and protect his business-friendly policies. Medvedev said he had submitted amendments to the Civil Code to the country\u0027s Parliament, in a move analysts say was long overdue. The president said the amendments should \"help to strengthen the foundations of our economic life and improve our country&#8217;s investment climate.\" \"It [the draft law] concerns practically every aspect of property relations in our country,\" Medvedev told an ad-hoc meeting of his senior administration officials at his Gorky residence outside Moscow. The policy thrust of the Kremlin&#8217;s draft bill is to improve good governance practices and transparency of legal entities operating in the country. Through a raft of amendments to the Civil Code, the Kremlin has tried to streamline and simplify procedures for registration of legal entities and to set new rules for economic activities, such as bankruptcy and mortgage lending, Justice Minister Alexander Konovalov told reporters in the Kremlin on Monday. Some familiar forms of legal structure, such as additional liability companies and closed joint-stock companies, will cease to exist in Russia, Konovalov said. \"The novelty of this draft law is that it systematizes the organization of legal entities, and first of all, that of commercial organizations and NGOs.\" Konovalov said legal entities in Russia will henceforth be delineated into public companies and private companies, while every legal entity will be expected to prepare its financial statements and shares-issue in line with the new regulation. Certain business-friendly provisions in the draft bill, the Kremlin hopes, may also persuade Russian companies not to register their businesses abroad. \"It\u0027s common knowledge that big Russian businesses are increasingly moving to foreign jurisdictions these days,\" Konovalov said. \"We must create adequate legislation and its enforcement in our country that would prevent businesses from going abroad to sue each other or resolve conflicts, but enable them to do this in our country.\" Many Russian businesses, which operate solely or primarily in Russia, are owned by holding companies registered abroad, meaning that the company can use foreign jurisdictions in case of legal disputes, the Associated Press reported on Monday. Russian business people often prefer European law and courts for their legal battles because the Russian legal system is seen as arbitrary and laws are outdated and vague, the agency said. President Medvedev ordered the Justice Ministry to prepare amendments to the bill in November, saying that they had to be ready by February 1, 2012. During a February 2 meeting in the Kremlin, Konovalov assured the president that the passage of the amendments will ensure that the \"interests of investors and creditors will be protected in Russia in a substantially more reliable, modern and more correct way than they are now.\" He added that the amendments \"offer new judicial and legal opportunities for the benefit of those who are investing and are engaged in business in Russia.\" \"A considerable amount of effort has been invested to ensure that contractual rights and liabilities, property transactions, deals and contracts &#8211; that is, everything that constitutes economic relationships in Russia today &#8211; are legally guaranteed,\" Konovalov said. However, the draft law still includes some controversial provisions, including requirements for offshore companies operating in Russia to disclose their beneficiaries. Konovalov said the provision was necessary to increase the transparency of the Russian economy and to prevent tax evasion. In order to fight sham companies, the minimum share capital for limited liability companies has been increased to 300,000 rubles, or $10,000, and up to one million rubles, or $33,000, will now be required to form a joint stock company. Some legal experts have taken issue with some of the provisions in the draft law. The increase in the minimum amount of capital required to start a company will have a negative impact on entrepreneurs willing to launch legitimate small and medium-sized business, according to legal experts at the law firm Muranov, Chernyakov & Partners. &#8220;Businesses will have to seek additional funds to increase their share capital. And the only way they can do this is by increasing the cost of goods, services or works,&#8221; said the experts. &#8220;It is also likely that small businesses that cannot find affordable finance to increase the capital may decide not to do business in Russia at all.&#8221; The legal experts also said the requirement that offshore companies operating in Russia disclose information about their beneficiaries is no less controversial. &#8220;First of all, it is unclear how this measure can affect transparency of business in Russia,&#8221; said the experts. &#8220;Secondly, asking offshore companies to reveal beneficiaries while information about property or assets of government officials is hidden from society is, to put it mildly, unfair.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirst published in Russia Profile.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"Author": "Aleksey Ekimovsky, Kirill Slepynin",
				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eFor the past several years, Moscow&#8217;s three biggest airports, Sheremyetevo, Domodedovo and Vnukovo, have been competing with each other for both passengers and airlines. Although this is common practice in many other countries, it has been a learning experience in the Russian capital. During the Soviet era, the three served different purposes: Sheremetyevo was the main international airport and the largest one in the country; Domodedovo was planned as a hub airport for long-haul flights to Siberia, the Far East and Central Asia, and it also served medium-haul flights to the Volga Region and Ural; Vnukovo traditionally served flights to Ukraine and Black Sea resorts. But with the end of the Soviet Union, Sheremetyevo remained the property of the state, while 75 percent of Vnukovo was transferred to the Moscow City Government, and Domodedovo became a private enterprise managed by the East Line Group. In recent years, Domodedovo emerged as the leader in passenger traffic among Russian airports. In 2011, Domodedovo served 25.7 million passengers, Sheremetyevo &#8211; 22.6 million passengers and Vnukovo &#8211; 8.2 million passengers. Domodedovo now serves about 46 percent of Moscow passengers, Sheremetyevo &#8211; 40 percent and Vnukovo &#8211; 14 percent. In 2010, Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov floated the idea that the tough competition among the airports could prove detrimental to the development of Russian aviation and suggested merging the three airports and creating a single management company. His words were later echoed by Minister of Economic Development Elvira Nabiullina. In December 2010, a consortium led by Credit Suisse and Troika Dialog finished its preliminary appraisal of the assets of all the three airports and valued Vnukovo at between $500 million and $700 million, Sheremetyevo &#8211; $1.6-2.4 billion, and Domodedovo &#8211; $4.1-5.1 billion. The assessment meant that in a consolidated company, the state&#8217;s share could not exceed the amount of shares needed to block action, and that control over a unified airport company would belong to the private shareholders of Domodedovo. As this situation was not what state officials had in mind, in April 2011, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced the decision to merge the Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo airports first. &#8220;This step is aimed at creating a single complex, equipping it with the use of modern technologies and then introducing it in the market and privatizing for an appropriate market price,&#8221; Putin said. &#8220;We proceed from the need for synergy, which will create conditions for a substantial increase in the capacity of cargo and passenger traffics and will substantially reduce the burden on the federal budget.&#8221; Meanwhile, the real goal of the airport merger began to trickle out as early as January 2011. Market experts are certain that the decision to merge the Moscow airports was brought about by the desire of government officials to sell state-owned assets to the highest bidder. According to Minister of Transport Igor Levitin, some foreign companies are already willing to negotiate on the subject with the Russian authorities. &#8220;We got offers from big European operators, from Southeast Asia, from an operator of an airport in Singapore and American operators as well,&#8221; Levitin said.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLong Way to Consolidation\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eConsolidating the airports&#8217; assets turned out to be a difficult task, partially due to the fact that the ownership structure of each airport is extremely tangled. In May 2011, the shareholders of Sheremetyevo stated that they had eliminated all the disagreements in the appraisal of the airport complex and of the modern D terminal &#8211; which is under control of an Aeroflot subsidiary &#8211; thus removing all obstacles to the consolidation of shares. Nevertheless, the consolidation was finished on April 2, 2012. After the Terminal Company&#8217;s accession, the government&#8217;s share in Sheremetyvo was decreased almost to 83 percent, Aeroflot got about 9 percent of assets and while two government banks - Vneshekonombank and VTB &#8211;  took approximately 4 percent of assets. For its part, Vnukovo&#8217;s ownership structure is no less complex. A part of the airport&#8217;s property belongs to companies whose main shareholder is a group of private investors headed by businessman Vitaly Vantsev. He does not insist on the state buying out his share, and is willing to exchange it for shares of the consolidated company. But the state would prefer to have Vantsev out of the way and plans to introduce some amendments to the law in order to eliminate the need to buy him out.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eA Difficult Partner\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe final stage of the Moscow air hub consolidation should be the takeover of the largest airport &#8211; Domodedovo, as Shuvalov announced in 2010. State officials have never explained how the state plans to take control over the airport, but the airport&#8217;s owner, the East Line group, is already willing to sell. In May 2011 Domodedovo attempted to launch an IPO, but it was cancelled at the last minute. Last fall, East Line began searching for buyers for the entire airport, but was unable to find anyone willing to pay the reported $5 billion price tag. However in March the Summa investment company started negotiating with stated-owned Sberbank (Russia&#8217;s largest bank) about the $ 2 billion loan to buy the airport. Meanwhile, in early April another investment company A1 &#8211; the department of the Alfa-group consortium &#8211; submitted application for a loan from Vneshekonombank to buy the airport. Both of A1 and Summa are ready to pay $ 3 billion dollars for Domodedovo. The airport price could decrease due to the terrorism attack that took place at Domodedovo in January 2011, which resulted in the deaths of 37 people. The attack forced the state to take a closer look at Domodedovo&#8217;s management, and the airport&#8217;s owners were severely criticized for its insufficient safety measures as well as their company&#8217;s registration outside Russia in a well-known tax haven. In addition, the Ministry of Transport limited the airport&#8217;s development plans, including the construction of a third runway. At the same time a decision was made to reconstruct one of the two strips which are currently in operation by the end of 2014 at the latest. As a result, Moscow&#8217;s largest airport will temporarily have only one strip and may not be able to efficiently handle its passenger traffic. This could lead to airlines departing for Vnukovo, where a new terminal has recently opened, or Sheremetyevo, where a third landing strip is already being constructed. In February, Sheremetyevo topped Domodedovo in terms of passenger traffic.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSynergy vs. Market\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAnalysts and experts have identified a couple of possible scenarios for the future. One is that, when transferred to new owners, Domodedovo will continue to develop independently and compete with a consolidated Sheremetyevo/Vnukovo. Another is that the new owners who have expressed interest in buying Domodedovo will do so and prove a more willing negotiator with the government, at which point the merger will go through. Alexei Komarov, chairman of the editorial council of \"Aviatransportnoye Obozreniye\" (\"The Air-trasport Review\"), believes that preserving competition at the Moscow air hub would be good for civil aviation. &#8220;The transfer of all the airports into a single ownership is fraught with serious risks. If the management turns out to be inefficient, it will affect all the three airports at once, but at that time it will already be impossible to turn the situation back,&#8221; Komarov said. He also notes that this is not the first time the government has attempted to consolidate state assets in aviation, and all the previous ones have ended with a failure. The most notorious of these was the Rosavia project, in which the government tried to create a competitor to Aeroflot by merging six state carriers. Corporate procedures took so long and the airlines&#8217; performance worsened so dramatically, that the only salvation for them was to transfer the assets to Aeroflot.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eKirill Slepynin and  Aleksey Ekimovsky are the authors for market guide&#8220;Russian Transport&#8221;.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Last month, following media leaks through the Kommersant newspaper, agency general director Vladimir Popovkin presented a strategy to preserve Russia&#8217;s place among the top three space programs in the world.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eFinancing may prove to be a problem. Popovkin said the program will need up to 200 billion rubles ($6.7 billion) annually to be functional &#8211; more than double its current investment, according to Alexander Zheleznyakov, a member of the academy at the Tsyolkovsky Space Academy in St. Petersburg. Despite Russia&#8217;s role as the main carrier of equipment and crews to the International Space Station, and its development of Glonass, the only competitor to the American GPS, the country&#8217;s investment is quite low. Zheleznyakov said that the global space services market is diverse in possibilities and consumer applications, including navigation systems, satellite telephony and television, and high-definition photography, but that Russia is not yet taking advantage of it. &#8220;The world market&#8217;s value for these services is estimated at about $300 billion per year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Russia&#8217;s stake is less than one percent of the overall world market volume.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003ePopovkin&#8217;s proposed budget is still three times lower than that of NASA, but many analysts say a revitalization of the program will be impossible without the cooperation of private enterprise. It is here where the United States&#8217; experience offers Russia a case study with two companies. Unlike missions during the Cold War, Popovkin said that manned flights and &#8220;space infrastructure&#8221; will not be a priority for the space industry, but rather applied uses. The main purpose will be the &#8220;creation of an orbital cluster that would help improve people&#8217;s lives,&#8221; he said, citing weather satellites and the Glonass navigation system as the most prominent examples and most in need of continued development. &#8220;Farmers, businessmen and individuals alike should profit from the results of our activity,&#8221; Popovkin said.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003e&#8220;Our satellite grouping as of now is not enough to satisfy modern market needs, while additional reserve satellites are to be deployed to secure communications,&#8221; Zheleznyakov agreed. Aside from the technical requirements, Russia faces an urgent need to create a &#8220;solid consumer base&#8221; for Glonass devices and related services, he said. Domestic supply of data and equipment in other areas are lacking, too, Zheleznyakov said. As of March 2012, Russia had only two active weather satellites orbiting Earth, the Electro and the Meteor- M, which he maintains are not enough for a country the size of Russia. &#8220;We keep buying meteorological data abroad, from France and other countries,&#8221; Zheleznyakov said. Popovkin&#8217;s space strategy looks to be aiming at exactly this goal, with Russia producing by 2020 most of the services it currently gets abroad, and replacing imported hardware components that the agency claims are unable to withstand the force of cosmic rays, a fault that it holds responsible for the failure of the Phobos Grunt probe.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eOne possible solution is for funding is a proposal of support from the Skolkovo foundation. &#8220;The logic of the process is that startups in the space industry should be supported on the seed stage by the foundation,&#8221; said Pavel Sharov, project manager with the Space Technology and Telecommunications cluster at Skolkovo. &#8220;Later they should be picked up as part of the space industry upstream supply chain, or may compete at the commercial market of downstream space applications, like navigation and geoinformatics solutions.&#8221; Sharov&#8217;s optimism about future business development of space program projects is supported by two deals the foundation has recently signed, with the Energia Corporation, boosters builder, and the Krasnoyarsk satellite and space communications company ISS-Reshetnev, to establish research and development centers at Skolkovo that could lead to new consumer applications.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eDespite the emphasis on applied uses, the program will not ignore the needs of pure research. Scientific missions are planned to increase from the current one annual launch, Kommersant reported. More space telescopes are also on the agenda, Zheleznyakov said. The new Vostochny spaceport in the Russian Far East will prove an invaluable support to space-based industry and research, allowing craft with heavy boosters, able to carry up to 180 tons of cargo. A manned lunar mission, an expedition to Mars, and unmanned missions to retrieve soil from Jupiter and Venus indicate the ambitions of the space program for the future, but a source of funding must first be determined.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eA controversial issue for private space missions is safety, especially on manned fl ights. Leroy Chiao, a former astronaut who traveled to the International Space Station in 2004 and 2005, was part of a 2009 U.S. government committee developing plans for future missions. &#8220;As a part of several options, we suggested that NASA help partially fund some commercial human space fl ight eff orts,&#8221; he said in an e-mail. &#8220;The idea was that if commercial orbital transportation could be achieved, then NASA could focus resources on exploration beyond low Earth orbit [further out in the solar system].&#8221; Government involvement, through NASA and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, will still be necessary to vet commercial operations for safety. Without a safety policy, Chiao does not see commercial space fl ight becoming a reality in the United States. The parallel Chiao off ered was air travel, with both airlines and airplanes subject to government inspection. Similar regulations would have to be placed on commercial space travel. &#8220;I would feel safe on a commercial orbital space vehicle, if that vehicle and company had been through the safety vetting process, which is yet to be established by the U.S. government,&#8221; he said.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRussia&#8217;s population is no longer dwindling, as the birth rate has been steadily rising since 2009. So much so, that in 2011 Russia became the largest market in Europe for children&#8217;s goods as parents splash out on the cute clothing and toys they never had when they were growing up in the former Soviet Union. The political stability of the past decade has helped inspire more couples to start families, resulting in a tidal wave of post-Soviet babies. This has fed through to the children&#8217;s goods sector and sales of baby clothes, baby food, toys and accessories have rocketed, allowing chains like Detsky Mir (Children&#8217;s World) to benefit. The toys sub-sector is one of the fastest growing of all non-food product groups, with the market expanding by 76 percent in the past five years, according to market information service PMR. Indeed, legendary UK toy store Hamleys is cashing in on the growth, and has just opened a new store in Moscow. In Soviet days, it was the dream of every child to visit Detsky Mir and queues encircled the huge building. Founded in 1957, the company has transformed itself into a modern retailer and is expanding fast. Vladimir Yevtushenkov, the owner of parent company Sistema, said in December at the Russia Forum: &#8220;I believe that the turnover will amount to nearly $1 billion (&#163;631m).&#8221; He plans to add another 25 stores to the existing 146 outlets operating in 73 cities around the country. There were 22 million children under the age of 14 in Russia last year, and sales in Moscow accounted for one quarter of the total demand for toys, says PMR retail market analyst Katarzna Twardzik. That represents a market worth $11.3 billion against the $7 billion made on toys in 2006, according to RBC Market Research, making Russia Europe&#8217;s biggest toy market. By contrast Germany posted $10.5 billion of sales in toys in 2009 but is only growing at an annual rate of 1.5pc. Most other major European toy markets are in decline. Despite the increase in births, this growth in sales of children&#8217;s products is in line with other aspects of Russia&#8217;s consumer market. For instance, Russia became the largest European milk market in 2011. By 2018, Russia is predicted to become the largest consumer market in Europe for all goods. With a population of some 11.5 million registered inhabitants, most consumer spending growth is concentrated in Moscow, the largest city in Europe. But as Russia recovers from the economic crisis, its burgeoning prosperity is spreading slowly to the 11 regional cities with more than a million residents &#8211; known as the Millionniki &#8211; turning Russia into a retailer&#8217;s paradise. Russia&#8217;s per capita incomes may be half of those in Europe, but as Russians have no debt to speak of they have the same spending power as Europeans &#8211; and they love to shop. Russia has already become the 11th-largest consumer market in the world and the second or third largest in Europe in many product categories, according to market research company Euromonitor. &#8220;Rising wealth levels over the past decade have turned Russia into a middle-class country arguably for the first time in its history,&#8221; says Citigroup&#8217;s chief Russian strategist Kingsmill Bond. Russia is quickly closing the gap on Germany &#8211; currently Europe&#8217;s largest retail market. Russia&#8217;s total annual retail turnover was $470.3 billion (&#163;296.9 billion) in 2009, according to state statistics agency Rosstat. In 2010, this figure rose to $543.5 billion, and grew by 5.4 percent in the first half of 2011. While Germany&#8217;s total retail sales are still higher than Russia&#8217;s, its growth rate was not as sharp, increasing by 1.1 percent and 1.3 percent in real terms in 2010 and 2011 respectively, according to provisional figures from the federal statistics office. With the increase in consumer spending power, Russians are looking to buy better quality and more sophisticated products. &#8220;Food is the fastest-growing segment in Russian retail,&#8221; says Ms Twardzik. &#8220;It can already compete with leading western European countries.&#8221; More generally, Russia&#8217;s clothing, footwear and accessories market is the fastest growing in Europe and was already worth $56.8 billion (&#163;35.9 billion) in 2010. &#8220;If it maintains its current 10 percent-a-year expansion, then it will overtake Germany to become the biggest market in this segment within the next two years,&#8221; says Ms Twardzik.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe symposium has always had a bit of a Russia focus, and this year was no different, featuring a half-day of sessions exclusively on Russia. Another highlight of this year&#8217;s event was the inaugural meeting of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission Innovation Working Group. The group was established at last year&#8217;s G8 summit by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and U.S. President Barack Obama and is headed by Medevedev&#8217;s economic aide Arkady Dvorkovich and Robert Hormats, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic, Energy and Agricultural Affairs. In its first session, the working group focused on particular problems that countries can work on together, exchanged opinions on the legal framework for innovation as well as future commercialization of the new technology. &#8220;Russia has a deep R&D (Research and Development) base,&#8221; said Lorraine Hariton, special representative for commercial and business affairs at the U.S. Department of State,&#8221;but the actual understanding on how to commercialize R&D is something that needs to be developed.&#8221; She also said that Skolkovo was a great opportunity for Russia to built its own innovative ecosystem. The Skolkovo group took advantage of the presence of major U.S. tech companies to sign agreements and roadmaps with American partners. During the symposium, Cisco signed a strategy document to create R&D presence in Skolkovo, as a part of the company&#8217;s multi-year commitment to invest $1 billion within the Russian Federation. &#8220;We are very proud and excited to initiate our R&D efforts in Russia with this agreement, particularly in Skolkovo,&#8221; said Marthin De Beer, Senior Vice President of Cisco&#8217;s Video and Collaboration Group, &#8220;Now we&#8217;ll start the work specifically in R&D in the video area We have two very large business associated with video, and video also drives a lot of networking space, so it is very important and strategic for Cisco.&#8221; The state-owned Skolkovo Foundation, which aims to establish an innovative center near Moscow, is only adding to its list of major international partners. I.B.M., Intel, Microsoft and General Electric are already working with the foundation. The center is interesting for big multinational corporations, because a partnership with Skolkovo comes with tax breaks and other incentives to make it easier to work in Russia. For small start-ups, however, the main value comes in access to government grants, venture capital, and a mentoring program. Russian start-up Kuznech, which was present at Global Technology Symposium, works on technology to make it easier to search within videos and images online. When the company ran out of the initial investment it received from its founders, they applied for a Skolkovo grant and received $1 million. Through Skolkovo, Kuznech also had an opportunity to receive feedback from venture capital funds to gauge its competitiveness on the global market. &#8220;We have largely improved our business model and focused more on monetization of the technology. So the feedback has helped us a lot,&#8221; said Michael Pogrebnyak, Kuznech C.E.O. Kuznech is an example of Skolkovo&#8217;s model, which works to connect good ideas with the money to make them possible. The foundation searches for start-ups &#8211; both in Russia and abroad &#8211; with innovative, marketable ideas and presents them to a pool of more than 30 venture capital funds. The funds decide which of the start-ups deserve investment, and offer grants ranging from $150,000 up to $1 million. Skolkovo was launched with a grant of $5 billion as a governmental effort to transform Russia into an innovation-based economy through partnerships with leading scientists, corporations and creating an environment for innovation. Currently Skolkovo boasts more than 350 companies and start-ups. During the Global Technology Symposium, the Skolkovo Foundation expanded its available funds significantly when it signed of a memorandum of understanding with Bessemer Venture Partners for a $20 million investment in Skolkovo participants over two years. Bessemer Venture Partners has been investing in Russia-related businesses since 2005, and its list of successful investments includes KupiVIP and Parallels. &#8220;At Bessemer we always try to follow the heat and the action and there is certainly a lot of it in Silicon Valley, but we also see it emerging in a very interesting way in Russia,&#8221; said David Cowan, a partner at Bessemer. Cowan said that his company invests a lot in other emerging economies, naming India as a country with rapid and sustained GDP growth, but that Russia is attractive for investors because it has both the innovative technology and large domestic market to support the start-ups. &#8220;When it comes to innovation in Internet and computer networking companies and energy related companies we expect to find a lot more interesting activity in Russia than in any other non-U.S. regions,&#8221; Cowan said.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"Author": "Tai Adelaja, Russia Profile",
				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRussian households incomes will spiral up in the near future, while average Russian workers will see their wages skyrocket, said the report, which was published on Tuesday. But some analysts said the report, which could influence investors&#8217; sentiments, misses the mark and will only send the wrong signal to a Kremlin already saddled with worries over a stretched budget. This is because investors are paying close attention to Russia\u0027s near-term economic outlook as an indication of whether a new six-year presidential term for President-elect Vladimir Putin would bring the much-needed improvements to the country\u0027s poor investment climate, analysts said. According to the World Bank baseline scenario based on an oil price of $98 per barrel, Russia\u0027s gross domestic product will grow a mere 3.5 percent in 2012, and will slightly climb to 3.9 percent in 2013. With oil prices at $125 a barrel, Russia\u0027s GDP growth could reach four percent in 2012 and 4.2 percent in 2013. However, the bank believes that Russia\u0027s WTO accession will drastically improve the country\u0027s economic fortune. Russia should see its GDP expanding by about 3.3 percent, or about $49 billion per year, as a member of the world trade block, World Bank economists said in their quarterly analysis of the Russian economy. In the long term, when the positive impact on the investment climate is incorporated, the economists said the gains should increase to about 11 percent or about $162 billion per year. The estimated gains are not one-off, but will repeat each year as long as the country sticks to an open economy trade regime, the economists said. WTO membership will have a substantial impact on Russian households too. The average Russian household would experience a gain of 7.2 percent of its income each year, while more than 99 percent of Russian households will experience gains within the range of two to 25 percent of their incomes each year. Skilled and unskilled workers&#8217; wages are supposed to increase by about five and four percent respectively in the medium term, and by about 17 and 13 percent in the long run. Skilled labor and urban households should gain relatively more than average due to the increase in foreign direct investment in the skill intensive business services sectors. However, rich households would gain less than the average household, since increased competition from foreign direct investment results in capital gaining less than labor. &#8220;The poorest households are estimated to gain at about the level of the average household, thereby reducing poverty,&#8221; said the report&#8217;s authors. There will be positive impacts at the regional level too. &#8220;All regions should gain substantially, but the regions that will gain the most are those that are most successful at attracting foreign direct investment, which depends on both location advantages and creating a good investment climate,&#8221; the economists wrote in their report. The regions likely to gain the most are the Northwest, St. Petersburg and the Far East. In a focused study of the telecommunications sector, the authors estimated that skilled workers&#8217; wages in the telecom sector would increase substantially from foreign direct investment (FDI). &#8220;Multinational firms located in Russia employ mostly Russians and will increase the demand and wages for Russians with the skills needed in their companies,&#8221; said the authors. The World Bank sees about 72 percent of the estimated gains coming from improved quality and lower prices of services that lead to productivity increases and the increased competitiveness of Russian firms. Another 18 percent will come from tariff reductions that will allow purchasing intermediate inputs and final goods at lower prices. Improved market access for Russian exporters accounts for the remaining ten percent. The only fly in the ointment is the increased competition from imports, which may lead to the displacement of some workers. &#8220;It is better for the government to provide assistance to workers to relocate while avoiding supporting the industries,&#8221; said the authors. &#8220;It is important to focus on the displaced workers, not the sectors.&#8221; However, Russian analysts said that the World Bank&#8217;s upbeat forecasts are overly optimistic, even when juxtaposed with similar estimates from the country&#8217;s Ministry of Economic Development. The growth in real disposable income should be four percent in 2012, and 4.4 percent in 2013 when the benefits of WTO accession are taken into account, according to the ministry. &#8220;A seven percent growth in household income is simply overoptimistic,&#8221; said Sergei Karyhalin, an analyst on macroeconomics and strategy at TCB Capital. \"That is a remarkably bullish forecast given the catalogue of cascading risks and economic headwinds earlier listed by the bank.\" Ariel Cherny, a researcher of Allianz ROSNO Asset Management, said Russia is unlikely to reap economic benefits from its WTO accession without undergoing radical economic reforms. &#8220;The overall optimism surrounding WTO accession wanes when one considers that systemic weaknesses persist,&#8221; Cherny said. \"There\u0027s need to restore investor confidence, particularly through fighting corruption, strengthening governance and protecting private property rights.\"\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirst published in Russia Profile.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The site has served more than 250,000 travelers to date. Travelmenu has just announced it raised an additional $1 million from its existing investors Almaz Capital and Runa Capital, bringing the company&#8217;s total financing to $4.6 million.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Russian online travel service market is young, but developing very\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003erapidly.

This represents a vast market opportunity. One specificity of the Russian travel market which is often misunderstood by foreigners, is its dependence on package tours. While in the US and many Western European countries, with the notable exception of Germany, outbound travel is arranged mainly through direct bookings with hotels and separately with airlines, in Russia there are major price advantages for consumers who book their travel through package tours. This holds particularly true for key holiday destinations. These price and product advantages are here to stay, but currently over 85% of outbound travel is locked-up and carried out by a few tour operators, such as Tez Tour, Coral, and TUI. We believe that the online travel market, which has so far been dominated by airline ticket sales, is now ready for the sale of more sophisticated and higher value package tours. We expect them to represent at least 20% of online outbound travel trips by 2015.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat are the key drivers, and obstacles,\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eof\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003efurther growth?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eOnline travel adoption is a function of Internet penetration. We strongly believe that the Russian market will follow the same trajectory as other advanced internet economies &#8211; or perhaps an even steeper one. Consumer demand for online products and services is now closer than ever to reaching a tipping point in the metropolitan areas of Moscow and St. Petersburg and it is only a question of time before the rest of the country will follow suit. In Russia as elsewhere, the Internet simply offers the consumer too many advantages &#8211; price transparency, easy product comparison, and 24/7 shopping without the need to leave the home, to name a few. Payments are another point of convergence. While cash as a payment method remains prevalent, we are already seeing 40% of our orders paid for by credit and debit cards. This percentage has risen significantly in the last 6-9 months. All e-commerce companies are working together to develop consumers&#8217; trust in the Internet as a transaction platform. Another interesting statistic we have seen is that Russia&#8217;s emerging middle class is estimated to make up approximately 68% of the total population, versus 31% in Brazil, 13% in China and only 3% in India. Inflation-adjusted per capita GDP is rising rapidly  and hence so is the ability for consumers to increase their discretionary spending on travel and entertainment related products and services.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat are Travelmenu&#8217;s distinctive advantages?

There is simply so much choice and it is extremely difficult to compare destinations and prices. Travelmenu wants to give the Russian traveler the power of choice by simplifying the labyrinth of travel products through smart search options and the best possible online content for travel destinations. Today Travelmenu has a larger database of hotels available online than any other online travel agency &#8211; and at better prices. We offer access to over 40 tour operators online and we&#8217;re increasing this number monthly. But our real differentiator is that we are the first Russian online travel agency to offer real-time booking of package tours, and we are extremely proud of this achievement. Having said this, Travelmenu will of course continue to also provide stand-alone hotels and flight tickets. Our focus on outbound rather than domestic travel is another clear differentiator from some other Russian travel start-ups. Moreover, we want to make it affordable for the Russian traveler to explore the world beyond the beaten track of Egypt, Turkey, and Thailand.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eOktogo.ru allegedly just\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eraised $10 million from VTB\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003ewhereas Ostrovok.ru completed no less than \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003ethree rounds\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eover the last year.

We are in ongoing conversations with a number of investors for substantial financing to be completed later on this year. The use of these funds will be primarily geared towards marketing and will be substantial enough for us to compete effectively in the emerging online travel market. Particularly due to our different focus &#8211; i.e. on outbound travel and package tours instead of domestic travel and hotels &#8211; we consider Ostrovok and Oktogo to be potential future partners rather than competitors by supplying additional Russian-based hotels to us. Travelmenu&#8217;s competitors are primarily the offline travel agencies currently selling package tours.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIs it easy for a foreigner to manage a startup in Russia?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eHaving lived in many different countries and experienced many different cultures, I have found that there are many more things which unite us than that drive us apart &#8211; and I am not just saying this to be politically correct. Of course there are some cultural differences, but Russian culture is not as different from European culture as let&#8217;s say Japanese or Chinese culture, and it has been easy for me to feel at home in Moscow. While as of now I continue to be the only foreigner at Travelmenu, the team and I communicate in English. My Russian is continuously improving, despite it taking longer than I would like and me still being quite shy about speaking. In terms of how Travelmenu is run, I do not see how it is any different from how it would be run in Europe or the US. It is a workplace filled with exactly those highly-skilled, entrepreneurial, and ambitious people, which makes Russia such an exciting market to be working in today.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHave you experienced significant cross cultural issues while working here?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe Russian online and technology landscape is filled with talented and highly skilled young people and hence intercultural differences are not as pronounced as they might be in other industries, such as oil & gas or banking. I  for one have not encountered many situations of intercultural misunderstanding that could not have been avoided if not for the language barrier. As for foreign specialists, they can be helpful if they have the relevant work experience and an open mind about adapting their skills to the Russian environment. Given the nascent nature of the Russian online market, of course there are many lessons to be learned from success stories (as well as failures) of online startups in other countries. However, I believe that often &#8216;what got you here, doesn&#8217;t get you there&#8217; and hence what is more important than strict adherence to what has been learned from previous experiences is the mental flexibility to adapt to a constantly changing market environment while selectively applying the lessons learned in the past.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKatrin Buckenmaier\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e \u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003eis co-founder and CEO of Travelmenu.ru.

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAs the world population grows, the global demand for food continues to accelerate, while food production resources dwindle. The total area of arable land is decreasing because of urban expansion, active use of fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, global food prices are volatile &#8211; Jikun Huang, director of the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy, admits that global food prices tend to have a stronger influence on domestic food prices each year, so cost-planning becomes harder for producers and consumers. According to estimates from Ramesh Chand, director of the Indian National Center for Agricultural Economics and Policy Research, to meet the global demand, food production must expand at least 3 percent annually for at least the next 20 years. So far, the world is lagging behind: From 1990 to 2007, world food output grew hardly more than 2 percent per year. How can a further 50 percent increase be attained? The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) has conducted a series of interviews with experts and market players from Brazil, India, China and Russia within the scope of its study &#8220;Agriculture in high-growth markets.&#8221; The document calls these four countries the locomotives of global agribusiness. The EIU believes the BRIC economies&#8217; successes can provide valuable lessons for other developing (for example, African) and even developed economies. What can agriculture experts around the world learn from the BRIC countries? Fewer subsidies. Europe and North America traditionally spend lavishly on subsidies to agriculture. The BRIC economies prefer alternative incentives, creating a more competitive entrepreneurial environment that is open to innovation, including for small businesses. In China, after the supermarket boom of the 2000s, a state program was adopted connecting local farmers with bigger retailers. In the early 2000s, Russia launched a grain intervention system enabling farmers to sell grain to the state when its price dropped below a fixed minimum. The scheme also works the other way around &#8211; when prices rise above the maximum, the state sells grain at the maximum price. This makes farmers relatively confident about how much they will get for their harvest. In Brazil, the state is participating in a weather-related rural insurance scheme against crop failures and natural disasters. More innovation. This includes achievements in soil management and creation of new crop varieties. Developing a new variety of any particular vegetable is not enough &#8211; you need to have it efficiently introduced by farmers. In 2009, India launched the Soil Health Cards program, establishing hundreds of laboratories around the country to analyze the quality of the soil in each field and provide owners with fertilizer recommendations to prevent degradation. For its part, Brazil has been successful in plant breeding. Although the country previously imported apples from Argentina, the country is now exporting them, because it has developed a tropical-resistant breed of apples. There is a downside to such innovative solutions, however, as many European countries reject any genetically modified foods. Despite these positive developments, emerging economies have plenty of challenges to address. EIU experts have pointed out the following fundamental problems that must be overcome for agriculture in developing economies to continue to grow. Infrastructure. Rustam Mirgalimov, CEO of the Razgulay Group, notes that the lack of infrastructure facilities drives up food prices in Brazil and Russia. The Russian Federation requires considerable investment in development of its rail transport systems and road network. Adoption of technology. Innovation is not always adopted in a timely fashion because of a lack of information, or poor access to technology, or unwillingness on the part of the regulator. In China, one-third of the labor force works in farming, which is slowing down modernization. It is a challenge in terms of promoting mechanization and increasing labor productivity. At the same time, India has the potential to double its agricultural land providing two crops a year (from 36 percent to 70 percent), but this practice is not widespread enough. Since the devastating 2010 summer fires, Russia has once again built up its grain industry to become a net exporter of grain to the world market, but the country faces stiff challenges from countries as diverse as Brazil, the United States and Kazakstan. In order to remain competitive, Russia must develop institutions that can manage the sector rather than relying on the government to do so.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirst published in the Slon magazine.  \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

But more and more people are playing and they want to do it on anything that has a screen: phones, TV sets, consoles &#8211; nobody cares how it all works,&#8221; said Alexander Lyskovsky, owner of Alawar Entertainment, a Novosibirsk-based video game developer.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBandits and patriots\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAlawar is currently one of the biggest games companies in Eastern Europe, with a turnover of about $100 million. Lyskovsky asserts that the global market for these casual, mobile-based games is about $1 billion, and that Alawar&#8217;s share is 9&#8211;10 percent. The company is mainly a publisher and distributor, cooperating with 40 studios that develop video games in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. In addition, Alawar has six firms making games exclusively for it. The company has all parts of &#8220;Farm Frenzy,&#8221; &#8220;The Treasures of Montezuma&#8221; and several hundred other games. Lyskovsky first began working in the industry in 1997, as a 20-year-old programmer and student at Novosibirsk University. &#8220;Two of my friends and I teamed up to make a big and complicated game financed by Krasnoyarsk oil pipes suppliers. Krasnoyarsk had a distinct brand of bandits. When we met them, they produced stacks of banknotes from the car boot and said: &#8216;We need you to make a game.&#8217; &#8220;One of their friends was the local writer Mikhail Uspensky, author of a trilogy about a warrior called &#8220;Zhikhar.&#8221; They asked us to make a game based on that book.&#8221; The game was released during the 1998 crisis. &#8220;We posted games [on our website] and the Americans started buying them like hot cakes, at $20 a piece. You sell five games a day and get $100, quite a sum in those days. And then something extraordinary happened. We got our first check from America, a real paper check for $500. It was Novosibirsk and the year was 1999. Three students came to the bank, produced some strange piece of paper and the clerks said &#8220;What is that? We don&#8217;t work with this kind of stuff.&#8221; We sent the check to Moscow and it was cashed three months later.&#8221; That was the beginning of Lyskovsky&#8217;s relationship with Western gamers.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCasual? What&#8217;s that?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eLyskovsky is now 34. His company is still based in Nobvosibirsk. He is not planning to move, for patriotic and financial reasons: it is cheaper to run a company in Novosibirsk than anywhere else. Lyskovsky himself lives on a plane, as he puts it. When asked if computer games were addictive, Lyskovsky said:  &#8220;Your cigarette pack has a warning &#8216;Smoking kills.&#8217; But it does not deter you or the producer. And wine? It&#8217;s bad for you, but everyone drinks and enjoys it. Games are just entertainment, they help you to relax. I am a gamer myself.&#8221; Lyskovsky calls his game casual because, as he said, &#8220;They are easy and simple, with short sessions, and they are addictive. For example, &#8216;The Treasures of Montezuma&#8217; and &#8216;Farm Frenzy.&#8217; Vampire games are very popular and we have a lot of them. I am fed up with them, but everybody tells me that they are trendy and we should make them. We are in the world media environment. If the game mechanics are standard, the script is dictated by the environment. When the &#8216;Cars&#8217; cartoon came out, it spawned lots of games. Any major media event creates a huge number of new games. Soap operas are light, entertaining and short; people become addicted and want to see more and participate. That is where we come in.&#8221; Developing a new game costs somewhere between $100,000 and $500,000, partially because they have to be developed for many different platforms, including Windows, MAC, iPad, iPhone, Android, PlayStation. Lyskovsky also likes to make games with complicated, well-drawn graphics, and his studio has a staff of 50. &#8220;Nobody knows how to make a game popular: it just happens,&#8221; Lyskovsky said. &#8220;I know the guys who created &#8216;Angry Birds.&#8217; Two Finns. They have a businessman uncle, nothing to do with IT. He gave his nephews money so they could make games because they liked it so much. The business made losses for several years, but their project number 38 clicked. And everybody began shouting, &#8216;Wow, Angry Birds, wow.&#8217; The moral? Nobody knows how to create a hit.&#8221; Lyskovsky is hoping to build on his experience with Alawar and develop a home for more IT companies at the Akademgorodok (Science City) technopark in Novosibirsk. &#8220;We are trying to build an industrial park at Akademgorodok, in conjunction with other Novosibirsk companies. We want talented guys from all over Russia to come there, to study and to work. Something like Silicon Valley. Actually, we need all this to solve the simple problem of human resources. We have to build a new city to attract young talent. As soon as a company becomes big, it has to tackle issues such as education and personnel and even roads. That&#8217;s the way things are here.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis article is abridged from the original version.

Indeed it has become far easier than in the past for Russian college students to meet their future employers. Corporations, dissatisfied with the content and quality of higher education, have begun working with universities to ensure that the human resources they need are properly trained. And any institutions of higher learning that have nothing to offer the business world may not be around much longer. Kirill Voronov, a fourth-year student at the Higher School of Economics (HSE), has no reason whatsoever to worry about finding a job when he finishes school: He is almost certain to be hired by PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the big four international accounting firms, where he is currently interning. The consulting giant has employees who teach at the HSE and PwC has a department at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation. Gazprombank project analyst Tatyana Sorokina also caught the eye of her future employer when she was a student: before graduating from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO), she entered their corporate stipend program, then was recruited for an internship, and finally, in 2009, she was hired full time. The Gazprombank hiring process has now become even easier for students graduating from MGIMO; last year the bank opened its own department, the Economics and Banking department, at the MGIMO International Institute of Energy Policy and Diplomacy. Specialists from the bank as well as senior executives teach classes at the university. How do companies become involved with universities? Few of them start right out with their own sponsored chairs or departments. Nikita Rakov, who handles relations with universities for PwC, described how his company&#8217;s decision to open its own departments grew out of a lecture series PwC consultants and accountants began giving at the university several years earlier. Later these were simply grouped into a single department. It is noteworthy that PwC and its direct competitors among the big four accounting firms each have their own departments at the very same schools: the HSE, for example, also has Ernst & Young and KPMG departments. Specialists from competing companies teach the same students, but they arrange for their courses not to cover the same subject matter. Major companies in the IT field are keeping pace with the accounting firms, although experts believe that Russian IT startups have only recently reached the level where they can allow themselves to take this approach to training personnel. &#8220;Only practice can provide practical experience in software engineering,\" said Alexander Tormasov, head of the Parallels scientific research program and a professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MFTI). &#8220;That&#8217;s why we not only provide our employees an opportunity to teach, supplementing their university salaries, but we also recruit students for on-the-job training. Without this, IT majors generally earn money as system administrators during their student years, and then they remain in this area after graduation, having wasted valuable time on work that is less skilled than software development. So we offer them a chance to do scientific research work on the basis of state-of-the-art technologies, paying a stipend of up to 24,000 rubles ($820), which is about the same as they could make as a non-payroll system administrator.\" Another factor driving employers to the universities is the shift of many education programs to the double-degree, bachelor\u0027s-master\u0027s system. &#8220;Potential employers were just as unprepared for these changes as were the university teaching and administrative staff, and the students themselves,&#8221; said Vadim Saralidze. &#8220;Someone with a B.A. should essentially be considered a specialist with a higher education, but that graduate has not actually acquired the specialization he needs, and has patently inadequate knowledge and skills.\" On the other hand, dividing the program into two degrees gives employers room for maneuver, and many of them have taken the route of setting up their own master&#8217;s programs.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe office pays\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eCompanies incur certain costs when they invest money in creating their own departments or corporate universities, or even just by assigning a highly paid specialist to assume teaching duties. The idea is that the invested funds will be recouped through the students themselves, for example, by their signing pledges to work a specified number of years at the company sponsoring them. In practice, far from all companies impose such requirements. &#8220;Although our terms do not include a requirement that a candidate stay and work at Yandex after finishing school, most of the students do become our employees. The rest of them find interesting work at other companies, which promotes the overall development of the Runet. So we think the return on our programs is above the breakeven point,&#8221; said Artem Babenko, head of the Yandex School for Data Analysis group. For major companies, the money spent on this type of project actually doesn&#8217;t loom terribly large. For example, oil major LUKOIL spent around 90 million rubles ($3 million) on support to universities in 2010. Usually companies don&#8217;t even supplement the university salaries of their employees who are on a teaching assignment away from their main job. As for the payback, Ernst & Young managing partner for Russia Alexander Ivlev noted that even if students who have received a high-quality education don&#8217;t subsequently go to work for their sponsoring company, they may later become its customers. On the whole, companies are not worried about building a human resources pool for their competitors, as well as themselves.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eConstraints on universities\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eIt is obvious that having a base to support practical experience, along with prospects for future employment, is becoming an increasingly significant competitive advantage for institutions of higher education. &#8220;When we reach the practical training stage, it&#8217;s always an awful headache,&#8221; said Andrei Semyonov, course supervisor at a commercial school that does not have its own base. &#8220;If the student himself has found a company where he can do on-the-job practice with good results, then he has lucked out &#8211; even more so, if he can get a job there later. If not, then of course we&#8217;ll find somewhere to send him, but the host companies will not be promising ones, from a career standpoint. My older son is entering college this year, and for me the main criterion for choosing a school is to make sure he&#8217;s not going to graduate with a diploma to nowhere.&#8221; In the view of Dmitri Yendovitsky, chairman of the Council of University Rectors in the Voronezh Region, institutions of higher education that cannot bring employers into the educational process will disappear very soon. &#8220;There are three basic phases of evaluating the work of a university,\" said Yendovitsky. &#8220;At entrance, it\u0027s the average grade on the standard test. This indicates the status and prestige of the university, because the entering students have voted with their feet. Then there are process evaluations: the quality of education, degree of diversity in the curriculum, and number of innovational projects implemented. At graduation, there is the issue of how much its graduates are in demand. The degree of business community integration into university processes is a factor influencing all three criteria for evaluating a university\u0027s work. Institutions of higher education that lack serious joint projects with the business community should gradually merge into the larger universities on which the system is based.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirst published in the Kommersant-Dengi magazine.  \u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003e \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eArkady Dvorkovich, economic assistant to President Dmitry Medvedev, said on March 20 that state-run companies will be required to transfer 1 percent of their spending on innovation development programs to the endowment fund of the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (SkTech). He said the fund would finance SkTech&#8217;s entire research program, and that some of the research would serve the interests of the contributing companies. The Skolkovo Foundation and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology established SkTech in 2011. The institute will focus on not only education, but also research, according to Skolkovo Foundation President Viktor Vekselberg. Budget funds are now being used to construct the university building. Endowment funds became essential sources of finance for Western universities, museums and hospitals long ago. They are traditionally funded by donations from several philanthropists or companies. This money is invested in securities and the earnings are used to finance daily operations and research. Previously, a presidential commission had instructed Russia&#8217;s 47 biggest state-controlled companies, including Gazprom, Russian Railways, RusHydro, and Aeroflot, to invest money in innovation programs. In January, the commission instructed the government to make provisions for contributions to SkTech&#8217;s endowment fund amounting to 1 percent of the state companies&#8217; innovation budgets, said Stanislav Naumov, Skolkovo vice president. &#8220;State representatives on boards of directors have initiated discussions of this mechanism and ways to allocate funds. All the procedures are expected to be completed by September,&#8221; Naumov explained. State contributors are expected to provide around 30 billion rubles ($1 billion) within three years, Dvorkovich said. In 2011-2015, allocations will amount to 58 billion rubles ($1.8 billion), according to Naumov. The endowment fund is projected to reach 16.5 billion rubles ($560 million) in 2012 &#8211; state companies are expected to provide 10 billion rubles ($340 million) and private partners of the Institute will donate the rest. SkTech plans to pursue a conservative endowment management strategy, with yield guidance yet to be identified, Naumov said. The return on investments may reach 15 percent of the fund, or up to 2 billion rubles ($68 million) in 2012, according to an unidentified source close to the fund. SkTech&#8217;s endowment fund will be Russia&#8217;s biggest. Russia&#8217;s endowment funds totaled an estimated 17.2 billion rubles ($600 million) as of early March 2012, according to Lyudmila Panteleyeva of Gazprombank Asset Management. The biggest fund to date belongs to the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO), which has accumulated about 900 million rubles. SkTech still has a way to go to get closer to the world records. In 2011, the endowment of Harvard University, the biggest fund of this kind in the world, earned $1.2 billion, according to its annual report. Harvard&#8217;s endowment value rose 16 percent to $32 billion in the 2011 financial year. The world&#8217;s second-biggest endowment fund, that of Yale University, amounted to $19.4 billion during the same period, with spending from the endowment for the University&#8217;s 2011-2012 fiscal year budgeted at $992 million, or around 37 percent of its revenues. RusHydro said it was working on mechanisms for transferring funds, and the press service of Russian Railways reported that the company would comply with the authorities&#8217; requirements. A spokesman for Gazprom said that it was familiar with the initiative, but it is not clear how the mechanism will be applied, for instance, which amounts should be used as the basis for calculating the required 1 percent, as Gazprom has a complex innovation development program. A source within one of the state corporations said that the companies are discussing the format for their involvement in the endowment fund with the authorities: the corporations are expecting some sort of haggling, or hope that at least some of the research to be financed from their funds will come in useful for them. State companies are enabled to conclude strategic partnership agreements with the Skolkovo Foundation and spell out the specific lines of research in which they are most interested, and Skolkovo will make them its priorities, Naumov said. &#8220;Anyway, we are interested in commercialization of our research, which is why we will respect business interests,&#8221; he added. For business to invest in an endowment fund is a chance to develop competencies in the research and educational system, which can increase their competitiveness. &#8220;New specialists will appear. We will be able to create and own technologies rather than import them&#8221;, he continues. For example, one of SkTech&#8217;s projects &#8211; the search for hazardous substances in luggage using of radiation technologies &#8211; reduces time taken for passenger checks, which is beneficial to both airlines and airports,&#8221; Naumov said. Directed contributions to a new fund infringe on the interests of state companies and their private shareholders &#8211; the authorities believe that any measure can be justified, a source close to the government said. Whether the money is invested following an order or not, is unimportant, in the opinion of the rector of the New Economic School, Sergei Guriev: &#8220;Skolkovo needs to compete with foreign universities and, without endowment funds, this will not be possible.&#8221; State companies could focus on investing in training new specialists on the condition that they employ them afterwards, said Leonid Gokhberg, senior deputy rector at the Higher School of Economics.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

She enjoys life in London, but can&#8217;t help missing ryazhenka, tvorog, kolbasa and pelmeni &#8211; casual food for most Russians, but something almost unknown in England and available only in few Russian specialist stores in London, such as Kalinka in Bayswater. &#8220;Even my husband fell in love with syrki (a sort of iced milk dessert), when we were in Russia,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But I think it&#8217;s unlikely that syrki might be on offer here, they are very sweet and I guess they could be considered an unhealthy food here.&#8221; There are many other goods that are popular in Russia and widely consumed there, but almost non-existent outside of the territory of the former Soviet Union. According to the President of the Russian National Union of Exporters, Dmitry Bulatov: &#8220;There is a strong demand for our grain within the international market and we have consistent marketing outlets in many foreign countries. But the situation with the supplies of prepackaged foods abroad is pretty dire. The activities to promote our domestic food products to the external markets leave much to be desired.&#8221; Although the export of Russian food has been steadily growing for the last decade from $1.5 bn in 2001 up to $7.1 bn last year, this data isn&#8217;t promising for the whole Russian food industry. The lion&#8217;s share of Russian food products are traditionally purchased by the former Soviet republics and only around a third or a quarter of these goods are imported by EU and other foreign states. It&#8217;s not surprising that ex-Soviet countries remain the major buyers of Russian food as, for many decades, they were a part of the homogenous market. Therefore, the stable trade relationship with these countries can be explained to a certain extent by inertia and shared history. But when it comes to the EU member-states, the USA and many other countries, only a few Russian food manufacturers have succeeded in exporting their merchandise there. For instance, Russian wines, produced by outlets like Fanagoria, Abrau-Dyurso, are distributed to Britain, Baltika beer from Saint-Petersburg reaches its customers in Denmark, while confectionary products of the Udarnitsa factory are consumed in Norway, and sweets and chocolates by Belogor&#8217;e enterprise from the Southern part of Russia go to Finland. &#8220;We have many outlets in Russia that produce innovative food items, that aren&#8217;t produced anywhere else in the world and could compete outside of the domestic market as well,&#8221; says Dmitry Bulatov. &#8220;Among them is a type of wheat called Zhitnitsa which is produced by a company called Pava. It has a unique nutritional composition and it has big export plans. Another exclusive producer is the Vimm Bill Dann company, which is acclaimed as one of the major producers of non-alcohol drinks and milk products. Vimm Bill Dann intends to distribute its infant food abroad.&#8221; Remarkably, alcoholic drinks remain one of the more lucrative items of export from Russia. It raises $116.6 bn from foreign countries outside of the former Soviet republics. In many countries that do have specialist shops selling Eastern European food products, often the Russian foods on sale are actually manufactured outside of Russia&#8217;s borders. The recent survey of Russian food manufacturers and food exporters conducted by the Ministry of Economic Development sheds some light on the problems that they experience when trying to market their products abroad. Many Russian food producers said that they experience difficulties in obtaining information on the foreign requirements that imported goods must meet, such as the sanitary and technical requirements. Most of the manufacturers complained that the restrictions from foreign markets were very harsh. For instance, the EU sets a wide range of restrictions on food imports regarding its wrapping, sustainability, contents, additives and so on. It is one of the reasons why many attempts to introduce Western consumers to specific items of Russian food fail. &#8220;The Russian companies should not consider the requirements of Western countries for imported goods a discrimination or sabotage,&#8221; maintains Dmitry Bulatov. &#8220;The food products of domestic European manufacturers meet these standards and fully correspond to them, therefore it seems fair that they set the same rules for import as well. But the main task here is to assist Russian manufacturers in their attempts to understand foreign markets and their regulations,&#8221; he added. &#8220;And we should also strive to negotiate with our existing and potential importers about bringing compatibility to our mutual food regulations and their import rules.&#8221; Another obstacle for selling to Western markets is that foreign customers are not familiar with many Russian food items and even the names of these products are usually hard to spell, such as pryanik or ryazhenka. This is because, for many decades, the Russian market has been isolated from the West culturally and politically and as a result people in the West are unfamiliar with the national food of Russia. Bulatov says that promoting Russian foods at exhibitions and trade fairs could help get the foods more widely recognised. However, he says the manufacturers also need to pay attention to their advertising materials. Brochures, booklets, media kits, and so on, need to be produced in different languages with clear explanations for each of the countries they are targeted at. Another fundamental obstacle that both the exporters and the experts point out is the insufficient level of support from the state. &#8220;A list of various fields of manufacturing that are eligible for state subsidies has recently been published, but the food industry, unfortunately, was not mentioned there,&#8221; says Dmitry Bulatov. Other measures that would help the underdeveloped food industry expand include business privilege taxation, promotional bank loans and other forms of support. The role of the national agricultural sector is vital in terms of Russia&#8217;s export potential, states Dmitry Bobkov, press attache of the Ministry of Agriculture. &#8220;We are about to reach the estimated targets of wheat, potatoes, sugar and sunflower oil production,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;The targets for poultry production are about to be reached this year too, whereas meat production will take another three to five years to reach its target. As agricultural production expands, exporting it will be a priority, according to the experts. But for now most of the food produced in Russia remains the domain of its domestic citizens and those living in Russia and the former Soviet republics.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe Internet seems to be creating a second reality and already in the economy. Take, for example, the latest model of the coveted Apple iPhone. In developed countries it actually has a set price, which is officially announced at a model&#8217;s launch. But in Russia, the situation is somewhat different. On Oct. 19, an ad appeared on the website of Russian coupon service BigBuzzy offering the iPhone 4S at a 54 percent discount &#8211; the phone would cost 19,990 rubles instead of the expected 43,199 rubles. Naturally, the online community began chattering about the mechanics of the scam: was it a pyramid scheme, where the first to pay would receive gadgets at the expense of later ones, or a coupon company that would banally disappear with all the money? Orders for the discounted phones closed on the night of Oct. 28. More than 7,500 coupons were sold. If all the buyers chose the cheapest modification (19,990 rubles bought a version of the iPHone with 16 GB of memory; 32 GB went for 23,990, 64 GB for 25,990), BigBuzzy collected more than 150 million rubles in 10 days. The organizers promised that they would be distributed the phones after Nov. 25. Mobile Research Group analyst Eldar Murtazin denounced the sale: &#8220;Getting an official phone for this money is impossible. Getting a phone by the specified time is impossible. Getting an unofficial phone for this money is also impossible (as long as BigBuzzy isn&#8217;t subsidizing them). Is it a scam? Certainly,&#8221; he wrote on his LiveJournal blog. Murtazin returned to the topic several times on various websites: &#8220;The purpose of this scam is to replenish the working capital of the company and then, perhaps, return the money,&#8221; he wrote elsewhere.  On Nov. 25, no one received an iPhone. BigBuzzy&#8217;s Sergei Belousov stressed what he had said from the very beginning: his company would start distributing the phones on Nov. 25 &#8211; if, by that day, the official distributors of the iPhone in Russia had received the first batch. For those tired of waiting, BigBuzzy refunded the money to the credit cards used to make the purchase. By the end of February, around 3,000 participants in the sale had gotten their money back. But &#8211; those who decided to wait eventually received the coveted phones. More than 2,000 buyers have received their phones and BigBuzzy has promised to fulfill all the orders by the end of March. &#8220;The first batch &#8211; 800&#8211;900 phones &#8211; had to be bought retail,&#8221; said Belousov. &#8220;I had to personally buy the first 60-something iPhones at the store on Tverskaya. As soon as they came in, I went and said, &#8216;Let&#8217;s have them all.&#8217; Then I transferred money to the accounts of seven of my top executives, and they went with cards to buy through all channels. Later, two operators did ship us some of the phones through direct contracts after all. With one of them we signed a dealership contract, with another we are about to came to an agreement on it.&#8221; Murtazin maintains the sale was still a scam. &#8220;For all intents and purposes, they obtained credit which they could put into use,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As soon as they receive some percentage of the loan, they buy the next batch, and distribute it to the waiting.&#8221; What happened? Belousov decided to market his business through this sale. Rather than putting money into advertising, he used the funds up front to offer a coveted product at a discount. How effective was the marketing scheme? Many people learned about BigBuzzy, but, as Belousov admitted, the publicity was rather more negative than he had anticipated.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirst published in the Kommersant-Dengi magazine.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I learned Russian in high school, because my father before me had learned it in England as a student at Cambridge, where most of his math and science profressors were Russian.  And then he was involved in the US space program, which cooperated well with the Russian space program.  So in our family we liked the Russian people, even though we did not like the Soviet government.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEWDN: \u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eWhy do so many US web and tech companies come late to Russia, or do not come at all?\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEsther Dyson: \u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eBecause many other markets are more attractive and easier to operate in. For foreigners, the language itself is a problem. Because there are so many Russians, fewer Russians have learned English than in countries such as the Czech Republic or Hungary, let alone the Netherlansds or Sweden. In this way, Russia is similar to Germany or Spain, where there is a large enough local market that fewer people learn a second language. But second, there&#8217;s a lack of business experience. Most people don&#8217;t have parents or other relatives who ran a bookstore, worked as manager, sold industrial piping or started a restaurant.  Very few have been well managed, so they themselves dont know how to manage either.  They don&#8217;t know how to write an email that makes it clear what kind of response they want. It&#8217;s the simple things that Westerners take for granted that are most lacking.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEWDN: \u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eDo you see differences between a Western and a Russian startup?\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEsther Dyson: \u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe big difference is that in Russia there is much more regulation and corruption, and that it is hard to find experienced business managers (even though it is easy to find highly intelligent and qualified engineers).\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEWDN: \u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eIs corruption an obstacle to innovation?\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEsther Dyson: \u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eObviously, there&#8217;s a lot of corruption in Russia &#8211; even more than in many other countries. But fortunately, around the world, the Internet is changing things for the better. To the extent that an economy moves online, corruption usually diminishes. First of all, there is simply more record-keeping, and transactions are automated, so bribery is harder to implement and harder to cover up. Separately, so much of the Internet economy empowers individuals. It may be cost-effective to bribe a manager in a large company to give you a contract you don&#8217;t deserve, but you can&#8217;t bribe millions of consumers to buy your products or use your online service.  Overall, the online economy is more efficient and allows the best players to win by pleasing customers rather than bribing middlemen. And finally, in some ways online services can reduce the costs of being honest.  One of the most wonderful innovations in Russia is the online kiosks that let you accomplish a variety of transactions online &#8211; including the payment of traffic fines. Now, instead of paying a cop a bribe in cash (to avoid getting a fine), you can simply pay the fine online. In the old days, paying a fine instead of a bribe involved going to the traffic police office or more recently the bank, which added a lot of inconvenience to the cost of honesty. Most people would prefer to be honest&#8230; now it&#8217;s easier.

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eA revolution is underway in Russia&#8217;s domestic capital market. In the first week of Feburary, demand for Russian government bonds outstripped supply more than fivefold as traders in London and New York snapped up the high-yielding 10-year Russian paper. &#8220;It was pretty spectacular demand, and the strange thing was that 70 to 80 percent of the bids came from foreign investors,&#8221; said a trader at Deutsche Bank, who preferred to remain anonymous. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen such high demand for [Ministry of Finance bonds] of this duration.&#8221; The auction raised 35 billion rubles, ($1.2 billion), more than twice as much as originally targeted. It was the first sale of Russian government bonds since a policy change opened up the local market to foreign investors without accounts or branches in the country. The new policy came into effect Jan. 1. Further liberalization of the bond market will come in April when the Russian capital market will be hooked up to Clearstream and other international settlement systems, making it even easier for foreign traders to tap the Russian market. The changes in the bond market are just the latest step in the ongoing reform of Russia&#8217;s financial system. &#8220;Russia&#8217;s financial infrastructure is undergoing its greatest transformation since the beginning of the 1990s, when the country made the switch to a market economy,&#8221; said Chris Weafer, chief strategist with Russian investment bank Troika Dialog in Moscow. &#8220;These changes could result in a massive re-evaluation of assets and removal of any risk premium associated with Russian equity valuations versus other emerging markets in the next two to three years; we will start to see the first benefits arrive in the next six months or so.&#8221; While higher-than-expected oil prices meant that Russia ended 2011 with a small surplus, the government expects a mild deficit to appear this year. In January, a deputy economics minister told reporters that Russia&#8217;s federal budget deficit in 2012 may amount to 1 percent of G.D.P. after a 0.8 percent surplus in 2011. To finance this gap, the state is turning to the domestic market, where domestic borrowing overtook foreign issue of Eurobonds for the first time in 2011. According to the Finance Ministry, the Russian government&#8217;s domestic debt jumped 42.5 percent in 2011 to 4.2 trillion rubles ($138.8 billion), including government guarantees, half of which is in fixed coupon bonds. This is slightly more than the total outstanding Eurobond market, which was worth $115 billion at January&#8217;s end. According to Weafer, these changes are just more proof of an ongoing shift in the center of gravity of the global financial system. &#8220;The opening of the Russian market in the 1990s moved the global financial center from New York to London, while the rise of emerging Asia moved the center of gravity from Florence to the Black Sea,&#8221; Weafer said. &#8220;The financial center is still moving, as Hong Kong is the fastest growing market in the world. But as Moscow lies between London and Hong Kong, its geographic position is perfectly placed to emerge as a major regional market.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

A major factor influencing them is corruption, which arises in some cases as a result of certain groups wanting to enrich themselves and in others simply because of a lack of transparency. Any businessperson needs to have an idea of when a given project can yield returns, and any changes to the rules lead to higher risks and a lack of predictability. Current ethical and corporate norms, both among Russian and foreign businesses (especially large ones), dictate that they don&#8217;t go where crime and corruption are present. Without working on these problems, we won&#8217;t get the trust of the local population and it&#8217;s won&#8217;t be possible to solve the socioeconomic problems facing the region. Solving them will in turn help us earn the trust of businesses that come here.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIshaev: \u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eThis problem is not as easy to solve as it may seem to some of your readers because businesses don&#8217;t have barriers when profits are guaranteed. The same businesspeople who cite international political disputes and other factors when I ask them why they&#8217;re not investing here will turn around and tell me that the Sakhalin-1 and -2 gas projects are &#8220;a different matter.&#8221; I&#8217;ve formed a &#8216;White Book&#8217; council where we ask foreign investors what problems they face to doing business here. While they cite the obvious problems with Russia&#8217;s climate, political and commercial factors in their own countries abound. They&#8217;re not eager to transfer technology and value-added production because they don&#8217;t want to see a new competitor. In the end most of the problems hurting our image have to be addressed nationally; it&#8217;s impossible to fight corruption in one particular region of the country. Society has to mature and the government has to mature.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRBTH: Everyone I&#8217;ve talked to in Vladivostok is concerned about people leaving the region (in fact, the entire Far East) and demographic decline.

They were attracted by the bonuses the state paid them to move out here. We need these &#8220;federal bonuses&#8221; nowadays. We did surveys to find out what people need to stop moving away from here. The respondents told us obvious things &#8211; give us good jobs, give us adequate wages, give us housing, give us accessible healthcare and education.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRBTH: Are there any positive examples of this?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIshaev:\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003e I worked for many years as governor of the [neighboring] Khabarovsk region, and we were able to achieve population growth.  And not because people from Western Russia moved there, but because they moved from other parts of the Far East. Businesses moved from Vladivostok. I supported their development &#8211; I helped them get fair prices for connections to the grid and other state services. But European Russia is still developing more rapidly and approaching Western European standards of living. The Asia-Pacific region of the world is also developing, and we&#8217;re getting left behind. It&#8217;s like Russia is being torn apart from within. We used to send 75% of the products made here to the rest of Russia; now we face the opposite situation &#8211; we consume, and don&#8217;t send anything there. To reverse this situation we need to free new businesses from taxes until they become profitable &#8211; we can invite investors into special zones.

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eA total of 96 of the world&#8217;s 1,226 billionaires come from Russia, putting it in second place &#8212; up from third place last year &#8212; after the United States, which boasts 425 people whose fortune exceeds $1 billion, according to the annual billionaire ranking published by Forbes magazine Wednesday. China has 95 billionaires this year, Forbes said. Russia has a historic reason to be among the world&#8217;s leaders by the number of billionaires because control over the biggest companies was consolidated in the hands of a few businessmen during the privatizations in the 1990s, said Vyacheslav Smolyaninov, a strategist atUralSibCapital. &#8220;It&#8217;s a typical Russian phenomenon,&#8221; he said by telephone. The second reason, Smolyaninov said, is Russia&#8217;s reliance on raw materials. The country&#8217;s economy has yet to pick up, &#8220;but the downturn is over for sure and careful optimism exists,&#8221; he said. Indeed, most Russians on the Forbes list own assets in the metals and mining or oil and gas industries. But while falling metals prices slashed the fortunes of the owners of metal companies, Usmanov, who controls the country&#8217;s biggest iron-ore producer Metalloinvest, saw his wealth grow to $18.1 billion from $17.7 billion in 2011. &#8220;Usmanov took the lead on the list of the wealthiest Russians, and it was not metallurgical assets &#8212; on which his fortune had been based previously &#8212; that helped him to achieve it, but virtual ones,&#8221; Forbes&#8217; Russian edition said. Usmanov started investing in telecommunications assets a few years ago and owns stakes in Facebook, Groupon, Zynga, Twitter, as well as the country&#8217;s biggest mobile operator MegaFon. &#8220;It&#8217;s proper to call him not a metals tycoon, but a high-tech now,&#8221; Forbes&#8217; Russian edition said. The value of Usmanov&#8217;s 5.5 percent stake in Facebook exceeds $4 billion, according to estimates by Bloomberg. This brings his overall fortune to more than $20 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a rival ranking to Forbes. As a result, the tycoon pushed back the owner of Novolipetsk Steel, Vladimir Lisin, who has topped the Forbes ranking of Russian billionaires for the last two years. Lisin&#8217;s fortune dropped from $24 billion in 2011 to $15.9 billion, putting him in second place in this year&#8217;s ranking. His rival Alexei Mordashov, owner of steel giant Severstal, was ranked third with an estimated fortune of $15.3 billion. Mordashov was ranked second last year with $18.5 billion. Among other tycoons on the Forbes list were Interros head Vladimir Potanin, LUKoilchief executive Vagit Alekperov and head of Onexim Group and recent presidential candidate Mikhail Prokhorov.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBefore you came to Skolkovo, you worked on strategic development at the state corporation Rosatom. Was it then that you developed an understanding that there were alternative areas and markets for nuclear energy?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eI suppose the idea was shaped even earlier, and I was not the only one. If we take a look at the strategic documents of the nuclear industry of the late 1980s, we&#8217;ll see many of the new directions outlined there. There are at least two reasons for pursuing diversification in the nuclear sector. The first is that the market is too sophisticated, so there is a lot that does not depend on us. Take Fukushima &#8212; it happened outside Russia, but it had a direct impact on us. The second reason is that the markets for allied technologies are growing much faster than the energy market, but their volumes are already comparable. The range of the nuclear industry know-how that can be applied outside the energy market is estimated to include at least 500 products and solutions. Many of them constitute part of the new technology platform &#8220;Radiation Technologies&#8221; adopted by a special commission with the Russian government and given priority status.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eCurrently you supervise this platform as director of the nuclear technologies cluster at the Skolkovo Innovation Center?\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003e\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eYes. This platform is officially coordinated by the Skolkovo Center and our cluster. Overall, four strategic directions have been identified for the nuclear technologies cluster, based upon general development trends in the nuclear power sector, analysis of global progress and this country&#8217;s capabilities, including its personnel potential. I won&#8217;t go into detail, but simply enumerate them. They include radiation technologies (radiation-based solutions); development of new properties of materials; technologies to design, construct, model and engineer complex technological facilities and systems; engineering, instrument-making and new electronics solutions. These all are spinoffs of the nuclear program, to a greater or lesser extent.\u003c/t\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy was Skolkovo given authorization to coordinate the &#8220;Radiation Technologies&#8221; platform, not Rosatom?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThere are more than 70 organizations currently engaged in radiation technologies within the scope of this platform, and Rosatom is just one of them. As far as its competencies are concerned, it is, indeed, potentially the most powerful investor and a player capable of assembling end products. But, because of its sheer scope, Rosatom cannot support companies worth, say, $1 million dollars. A nuclear power plant is a tangible facility, but when it comes to what we are going to search for and nurture, the state corporation won&#8217;t even notice such things. We pave the way. We support the creation and development of new projects and companies, that will later be included in the technological chains of global technology corporations by acquiring them, working with them in any way possible. We believe it is crucial that as many people and companies as possible choose this direction in which to move and this platform to rely on when building their long-term strategies. This is the essence of my job. Fundamentally, the main challenge is to start the wave, not just support two or three projects, however promising they might seem.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow much time will you require and what steps need to be made? Are there instruments for measuring and assessing the wave you initiate?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eI have a model in my head that looks roughly as follows. Essentially, we are talking about making a decision to launch a new industry. Judging from international practice, a decision of this kind requires five to 10 years, depending on the country. For instance, Singapore launches a new industry once every seven years. They take seven years to think, analyze, check and double-check. I perceive and interpret Skolkovo&#8217;s potential in this context as &#8220;action research&#8221;. When our grants committee decides to support some proposed project, invest in a startup, it is a chance to assess the viability of the applicant company. We cannot check it by way of analysis, using a piece of paper and a pencil. We need to give people a real opportunity, let them try, face certain obstacles &#8212; when you have worked with them, you see their strengths and weaknesses. We need to organize this process.\u003c/t\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYou referred to Singapore&#8217;s experience. What about recent developments in Japan? Do you believe they are thinking about diversifying the nuclear industry and giving priority status to sectors other than nuclear power?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eI&#8217;m sure that, following Fukushima, this has become much more relevant. They must think about ways to diversify.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIn brief, what does Skolkovo resident status offer your foreign partners?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eTo be very brief, I&#8217;ll mention just two benefits. First, this will enable foreign companies to create their own R&D centers in Russia. In Skolkovo, they will be able to establish them without red tape and on a very tight schedule. Second, foreign companies, as soon as they partner up with some of the Skolkovo startups, will enjoy the status of exclusive innovation partner of Russia. When a foreign company joins the center, it gets special status to position itself in Russia. The Skolkovo team has experience and an understanding of how to deal with administrative obstacles, tackle customs problems, and much more. The center was designed and set up to shake up the existing bureaucratic model.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eDenis Kovalevich was born in 1979 in the Moscow Region town of Troitsk. After graduating from the Higher School of Economics in 2002, he managed a number of consulting projects in Russia&#8217;s Volga River regions. Before becoming executive director of the Nuclear Technologies Cluster at Skolkovo, he worked on long-term strategy planning for Russia&#8217;s state atomic power monopoly, Rosatom. Since 2009, he has been a member of the President&#8217;s Commission for Modernization.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAt the peak of the economic crisis in 2009, Russia&#8217;s Far Eastern city of Vladivostok erupted in protests after a decision in Moscow to raise import duties on cars. Residents took to the streets to defend a major source of revenue for the entire Far East &#8211; driving Japanese second-hand vehicles to the country&#8217;s Western territories for resale at a hefty profit. Following the introduction of new tariffs, the number of cars imported annually would plummet from well over 200 thousand to around 60 thousand. As thousands of riot police were flown in from Moscow to restore order, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin pitched a solution &#8211; assemble the cars in the Far East, thereby making the Japanese and Korean brands domestically manufactured and not subject to the same duties. By the end of the year, the Sollers automobile plant in Vladivostok, which currently manufactures five models of the Sang-Yyong SUV, was launched after moving production from Tatarstan. &#8220;It was a political decision,&#8221; explained Vasily Avchenko, author and Vladivostok correspondent for daily Novaya Gazeta. &#8220;It was part of a broader carrot-and-stick strategy for localizing car production in Russia.&#8221; After two years of work, the project is being hailed as a success by the Sollers management, which is quick to deny any political connection. &#8220;Sollers is a private company with an independent board of directors; the government doesn&#8217;t decide our development strategy,&#8221; explained Sollers Far East Director Alexander Korneychuk from his swanky office on the 3rd floor of the factory overlooking Vladivostok&#8217;s harbor. This week Sollers Far East launched production of its fifth model, the Actyon &#8211; the first with a non-diesel engine. Production of the Actyon alone is expected to exceed 15 thousand units this year, while the total number of cars produced is expected to hit 35 thousand versus 25 thousand in 2011. &#8220;We were thinking of relocating production of the Ssang Yong models from our plant in Tatarstan to the sea coast for some time, but we needed a political decision to justify the required infrastructure investments,&#8221; explained Korneychuk. The facility now employs 650, mostly young workers. The average age is 27, and nearly a third occupy either management or training positions in the offices located on the upper floors of the factory. Sollers built the factory nearly from scratch in record time on the territory of a defunct ship repair station. Its bright orange-and-blue facility stands in stark contrast to the brick detritus and broken windows of neighboring buildings. When the company moved in, water was available for two hours a day. $60 million has been spent on infrastructure at the plant so far, with a gas connection still a half-mile away. &#8220;When we get the gas hooked up later this year, we&#8217;ll be able to start painting and sweltering the cars here on the spot. We&#8217;ll have a full scale vehicle production by 2014,&#8221; said Korneychuk. All of the components are imported from South Korea. Each model is assembled piece-by-piece until, at the end of one of the two types of assembly lines, a process workers call &#8220;the wedding&#8221; attaches the frame to the body of the car. The autos then undergo safety testing before being shipped by railroad to Western Russia. Fewer than five percent of the autos produced at the Sollers Vladivostok plant are purchased in the Far East. Exports to neighboring countries are not being considered as Russia &#8220;has the second-fastest growing market of off-road vehicles in the world, after the United States,&#8221; said Korneychuk. Despite the bleak view from the window, the location has been ideal for the operation Sollers is running. &#8220;We take the assembly kits off the docks right here,&#8221; gestured Korneychuk, &#8220;and put them on the railroad over there. Everything is within one kilometer. Our factory has no warehouse because we don&#8217;t need one. If a shipment is delayed, we are forced to stop production.&#8221; Moving the assembly line to the Vladivostok facility allowed Sollers to lower the price of the Ssang Yyong models throughout Russia (and sell more of them, according to Korneychuk), which currently range in prices in the Far East from between $24 and $40 thousand. Critics point out that the operation has been profitable thanks to federal subsidies that give Sollers a huge discount on shipping the cars by rail across Russia &#8211; subsidies that will eventually run out. But Korneychuk has his sights set higher: &#8220;Over the last two decades Japanese cars have developed a certain reputation throughout all of Siberia. People know and like them so much that they don&#8217;t require any advertising, a huge savings in costs,&#8221; he explained. Sollers is currently in negotiations with Mazda and Toyota to set up assembly of some of their models in Vladivostok (the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado may be launched later this year). &#8220;The original phase of this project was done to convince major international partners that it was possible to assemble cars here, and we did that,&#8221; said Korneychuk, adding &#8220;once Japanese cars are assembled here in Vladivostok, we&#8217;re going to make a huge dent in the second-hand car market.&#8221; The new assembly lines will be launched in neighboring empty buildings, property disputes aside. &#8220;Those buildings may be abandoned, but they still have an owner,&#8221; he emphasized. Meanwhile Sollers is under obligation by the federal government to localize auto parts production with each passing year. By 2015, no fewer than 10% of the components going into the Vladivostok-made cars will have to come from Russian producers. &#8220;We&#8217;ve found partners willing to invest in setting up such operations in the region,&#8221; said Korneychuk. Yet Avchenko is skeptical about a full-scale design and manufacturing automobile hub for export to other countries forming in the Far East anytime soon. &#8220;I reckon the politics of some nearby countries may prevent them from opening factories here, while the barriers to doing business would probably offset any savings in labor costs,&#8221; he said. For all of the successes of the Sollers Far East plant, it still only assembles foreign-made cars at its facility. Russians frequently lament the absence of a reputable domestic car brand. The time to make one, says Korneychuk, is now. &#8220;Russia&#8217;s got about five years until domestic demand is satiated and the market begins to grow at normal rates. Lexus showed that you can build a reputable global auto brand amid a normal domestic market, but it will be a lot harder later than if we do it now.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The computer programmer from the Moscow exurb of Zelenograd was simply annoyed by the traffic he encountered on his way to work in the Russian capital. While others opted to take the train, but Abkairov decided to start working from home, collaborating with Ramu Sunkara and Bhaskar Roy, two Americans of Indian descent, who were planning on leaving U.S. software giant Oracle. In early 2007, after nine months of development, the prototype for a company that became known as Qik  was finally finished. The program was aimed at increasing the functionality of mobile telephones. It enables mobile phones owners to upload videos and to make them accessible to friends. The app, which is now also available for video phones and chats, is now used by more than 10 million users around the world. The start-up of had a meteoric rise, and in January 2011, the company was purchased by Skype for $121 million. Today, Qik employs  50 programmers in Zelenograd . Graduates of the National Research University of Electronic Technology, which is also located there are in the envious position of having an excellent prospective employer just around the corner. The best part of this success story from the point of view from Russia&#8217;s IT sector is that Qik&#8217;s success is proving that Russian companies can compete in the global market with having to relocate to the West. Nevertheless, Qik&#8217;s success is dependent on an American company in Silicon Valley, where two dozen employees take care of marketing and sales. Without the business acumen of its partners overseas the project would have been doomed from the start, said the famously tight-lipped Abkairov in his only interview, with zelenograd.ru. &#8220;I would have never taken such a huge risk alone. I&#8217;m not that courageous.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eUntil now, Russia has been known more for talented programmers than business savvy, but more and more Russia-based IT companies are finding commercial success. Moscow\u003c/t\u003e\u003cb\u003e-\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003ebased software manufacturer Abbyy has become known for its text recognition program FineReader and its electronic dictionary Lingvo. At this year&#8217;s CeBIT, a major international trade fair for the IT industry, Abbyy focused on business solutions, as well as document and data capturing. The most successful international Russian IT company is without question Kaspersky Lab, which produces anti-virus software. Its earnings totaled $612 million dollars last year alone &#8211; a 14 percent increase over 2010 and a 57 percent increase over 2009. And 80 percent of this revenue came from abroad. Three other industry heavyweights have concentrated their efforts in the Russian-speaking realm: Russian search giant Yandex, and social networking sites Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki. Nevertheless, IT market growth within is not yet significant. In the words of Yevgeny Kaspersky, Russia produces &#8220;a great deal of qualified specialists, but precious few successful businesses.&#8221; Partially as a result, an increasing amount of start-ups are being tailored for the international markets right from the beginning. Alexander Galitsky, co\u003c/t\u003e\u003cb\u003e-\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003efounder and manager of the Russian venture fund Almaz Capital, believes that Russia&#8217;s greatest advantage lies in the &#8220;excellent programming institutions,&#8221; which provide their students with a first-class education, training software developers to be able to tackle complex problems. &#8220;Solving difficult problems, analytics, large quantities of data and algorithms are all areas where Russia can compete on a global scale. Those are traits once can expect when working with Russians,&#8221; Galitsky said. Galitsky proves his point by comparing two popular smartphone games. According to him, the more popular &#8220;Angry Birds,&#8221; from the Finnish Rovio Entertainment Studios, is not nearly as challenging as the similarly popular &#8220;Cut The Rope&#8221; from the Moscow-based ZeptoLab. &#8220;&#8217;Cut The Rope&#8217; has a completely different intellectual level,&#8221; and it is precisely this intellectual ambition that gets in the way of the Russian programmers. Ten years ago, many felt that Russia could be the first choice for IT outsourcing from the West, said Georgy Pachikov, head of Moscow-based Parallel Graphics. But, said Pachikov, &#8220;Our programmers see a piece of software and think to themselves, &#8216;I can do better than that.&#8217; In outsourcing, you have to stick to the regulations, which require a certain amount of discipline. Parallel Graphics conducts most of its business abroad, with Boeing and Airbus. According to Pachikov, the interest in domestic business is minimal. &#8220;The possible savings potential generated by our software is not worth the extremely large state operating costs. That is the difference between an extensive and intensive economy.&#8221; A better situation for Russian firms is collaboration with Western companies, according to Alexander Vovkula, the technical director of Parallel Graphics. &#8220;If the customer is not sure what they want, then welcome to Russia,&#8221; he said.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eViktor Vekselberg, owner of the Renova Group and one of Russia&#8217;s richest men has announced his resignation from the board of directors of RusAl, the world&#8217;s biggest aluminium producer. Vekselberg owns a minority share of 15.8 percent of RusAl through the company SuAl partners, which he co-owns with Leonard Blavatnik. Vekselberg cited the actions of RusAl management in his decision to resign. RusAl, however, countered the claim, saying instead that the move was a successful attempt by the board to unseat Vekselberg, who has served as chairman since 2007, but has not performed his duties for over a year. Most analysts and market participants take yet a third perspective, seeing Vekselberg&#8217;s resignation as a result of his ongoing disagreement with RusAl main shareholder Oleg Deripaska. There are thought to be three main reasons for the conflict, the primary one being differences over the ownership of 25 percent of Norilsk Nickel. Vekselberg and businessman Mikhail Prokhorov (who holds a 17 percent stake in RusAl) wanted RusAl to accept an offer made by Norilsk Nickel&#8217;s management and Vladimir Potanin&#8217;s holding company Interros to buy out RusAl&#8217;s 20 percent stake in the company for $12.8 billion. Deripaska, however, rejected the offer. Experts say the second cause of friction is RusAl&#8217;s decision to sign a long-term contract with the Glencore commodity trading firm, which owns 8.75 percent of RusAl), and that the third reason is that RusAl has not paid dividends since 2008, with the consent of the creditor banks. There is, however, yet another theory as to why Vekselberg is quitting. In 2010, Deripaska, Vekselberg and Glencore signed an agreement which required Vekselberg to give up his seat on the board to an independent figure after RusAl conducted an IPO. The company listed in January 2010 in Hong Kong. Regardless of the reason, Vekselberg&#8217; s decision to leave the RusAl board has had repercussions on the market. The company&#8217;s depositary receipts dropped by 1.61 percent to 6.1 Hong Kong dollars in Hong Kong on March 13, after which trading was suspended at the request of the RusAl Board of Directors. The company&#8217;s Russian shares dropped by 2.3 percent at the start of trading on the Micex index the same day.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eHSBC bank analyst Vladimir Zhukov believes that the short-term outlook for RusAl share prices is uncertain. &#8220;This year, the price of RusAl shares hinges on the price of aluminum. If it rises, the company&#8217;s shares will go up even though Vekseslberg&#8217;s departure has highlighted the existence of a conflict within RusAl,&#8221; Zhukov said. This view is shared by Andrei Mordavchenkov, the Partner company&#8217;s director for financial market operations, although he points to another important factor in determining the price of RusAl shares: &#8220;In addition to aluminum prices, share prices will depend on what Vekselberg does with his stake &#8211; sell it and, if so, to whom.&#8221; Interfax, citing its own sources, has reported that Vekselberg has no intention of selling his share in the aluminum company, but this has not calmed the markets. Analysts and investors have speculated that Prokhorov might be interested in purchasing Vekselberg&#8217;s share, which would give him more influence within the company. &#8220;Mikhail Prokhorov may well be a potential buyer for Vekselberg&#8217;s stake. He already owns RusAl shares and he may well want to increase his stake. Prokhorov has experience of corporate wars acquired from Norilsk Nickel, and it was successful experience. He may use it at RusAl,&#8221; said Bogdan Zvarich, chief analyst with the Net trading company. Valery Petrov, deputy general director of the Financial Markets Development Institute, is sure that, under current conditions, only those who already have a stake in the aluminum company might be interested in buying Vekselberg&#8217;s shares: &#8220;Outside investors are unlikely to buy the shares owned by the head of Renova because RusAl has a big debt burden and numerous court cases on its hands and its future in general is not very clear. So the main potential bidders for the stake &#8211; if Vekselberg decides to sell it, which is unlikely &#8211; are Prokhorov and Deripaska.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003ePrivate planes are no longer considered exotic in Russia. With a price tag about the same as a luxury car, more and more Russians are able to afford a light aircraft. Experts believe there are more than 3,000 private airplanes and helicopters in the country, even though individuals have only been able to fly legally in Russia since a 2010 government decree introduced concept of uncontrolled airspace and dropped the requirement for planes to have mandatory ATC service. &#8220;The new rules are working and have been tested during practical flights,&#8221; said Vladimir Tyurin, chairman of the board of the Aircraft Owners & Pilots Association. &#8220;The notification procedure has also been simplified. An electronic notice is processed within 30 minutes. There are fewer no-fly zones &#8211; a recently drafted instruction from the Transport Ministry will reduce the number of such zones to 400 from 1,200. Most of them are located around Moscow and the Central Federal District &#8211; the farther from Moscow, the fewer the zones, so there is less red tape for managing air traffic.&#8221; Despite these positive moves, there are many unresolved issues, including the high import duties applied to foreign aircraft. According to Tyurin, Russians who purchase a foreign-made airplane or helicopter, must pay an additional 42 percent of its cost in customs duties and value-added tax to the federal budget. Additionally, all privately owned airplanes and helicopters, must be registered according to local procedures. If the purchased aircraft is a make that has a Type Certificate, the process is fairly simple, only a few recent Cessna, Robinson and Aeroprakt models have been awarded these certificates. Owners of thousands of aircraft made by other producers have been faced with registration problems. For instance, if a model is discontinued, the producer will not apply for a Type Certificate in Russia, but Russian officials will not register a serial plane as a &#8220;custom-made aircraft.&#8221; &#8220;There is a way out,&#8221; said Tyurin. &#8220;You can upgrade your plane a bit by installing additional equipment that will suffice to have the model deemed to be a custom-built aircraft. This is a relatively fair means for circumventing the legislation, but it would be easier for everyone if the rules were changed and foreign Type Certificates were accepted automatically, without additional procedures wrapped in red tape, thus having foreign certification procedures recognized as safe.&#8221; Once a plane has been registered, it must be maintained, which is harder than it sounds. &#8220;Russian aircraft maintenance rules do not cover light aviation. The requirements on maintenance centers working with light aviation are so stringent that often they are simply unprofitable,&#8221; Tyurin said. According to him, there are a few centers that service Robinson helicopters (of which there are about 300 in Russia) and Cessna airplanes (of which there are around 100), and they report profits. But the state needs to reduce unreasonable requirements in order for new maintenance centers to be set up and work with other aircraft models. These problems are irritating, but not insurmountable; the bigger challenge for Russian owners of private planes is the lack of infrastructure. There are currently 300 airports in Russia that accept big commercial carriers, but do not welcome light aviation, and about 500 aerodromes and airfields that do accommodate small planes. In comparison, there are about 5,400 airfields for general aviation in the United States and 580 aerodromes for long-range aircraft. Development of the infrastructure for regional transportation could have a positive impact on light aviation according to Alexei Sinitsky, editor-in-chief of &#8220;Air Transport Review.&#8221; In February, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called light aviation &#8220;the only way for a country like Russia, with its vast territory, to connect various regions. It is no good when you have to travel to a neighboring region via Moscow.&#8221; Sinitsky doesn&#8217;t have much hope for high levels of state investment in the sector, however. &#8220;The recent victories in the struggle against red tape have been due to the enthusiasm of a few well-off and influential people, who have made amateur aviation their hobby,&#8221; he said. In some Russian regions, small airfields or landing fields remain operational only because some local businessman or Duma deputy who fell in love with the sky pilots his own airplane from there.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eKirill Slepynin and  Aleksey Ekimovsky are the authors for market guide&#8220;Russian Transport&#8221;.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"Author": "Vsevolod Pulya",
				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eConventional wisdom has it that Russia depends entirely on  energy exports and is incapable of producing anything on its own. The clich&#233;  has something to do with the nature of the media, which hardly ever report in  prime time TV newscasts the launch of new steel plants or write in a general-interest  magazine about achievements in the pharmaceutical industry. The Made Here site is designed to redress this imbalance, at  least on the Internet. The site is a resource devoted to new production  facilities in Russia, modernization, innovations, discoveries and successes  achieved on world markets. The project is the brainchild of an enthusiast, Roman Kovrigin,  a web programmer with 10 years&#8217; experience, originally from the southern city  of Rostov-on-Don now living in Moscow. Kovrigin began writing about Russian  industry in his blog on LiveJournal. After publishing a series of articles on  cutting-edge industries in Russia, which instantly spread throughout the Runet,  he realized that the project had outgrown his personal blog. In September 2010,  he launched the Made Here project, relying on user-generated content &#8211; anyone  who wishes to contribute an article or piece of news about Russian industry can  do so. The main goal of the project, as defined by Kovrigin, is to  bring back a sense of pride of the country. &#8220;It would be hard for us to move  forward without pride in our country and faith in its future based on its  achievements. If the results of your efforts are not visible, you feel  discouraged and lose motivation to work. We want to show that the results are  there and that our efforts are not wasted,&#8221; Kovrigin said. Initially, Kovrigin was the sole contributor to the site but, as  the resource has become more popular, more and more information has come from  the public. The site&#8217;s statistics show that there are now more than 500 active  contributors, and the site gets 12,000 hits a day, twice as many as there were  four months ago. Information in the community is verified by the participants  themselves and authenticated by photographs. There are no false or advertising  materials on the site; it is financed by donations from the participants, which  cover the operating costs. Kovrigin&#8217;s main complaint is the lack of time to  maintain the Made Here site, as he still works full time as a programmer.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRussia Beyond the Headlines: What structural changes need to  take place in the country in order to move it away from the &#8220;commodity track&#8221;?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRoman Kovrigin: The  shift has already taken place. Yes, oil and gas are an important part of our  economy, but what&#8217;s wrong with that? Considering our climate and the distances  involved, oil extraction is a challenging task. In Saudi Arabia, oil gushes out  of the ground under pressure. Here we need high technology to extract the  crude. You think oil flows down the pipelines by itself? No, it takes  sophisticated pumps to make it flow. Building gas and oil pipelines in itself  is a tough engineering task in our conditions. And think of offshore production  in the Arctic. Russia recently built the ice-resistant stationary platform  Prirazlomnaya. No other country has yet built such sophisticated structures  suited to the harsh Arctic climate. Commodities account for only about a third of Russia&#8217;s budget,  while two-thirds of revenue is not related to commodities. For several years  now, the GDP has been growing faster than its commodity component, which has  been virtually stable. In other words, rather than &#8220;getting stuck on oil,&#8221; we  are moving in the opposite direction. Russia is an industrial power. We produce things that few other  countries are capable of producing, such as nuclear reactors, turbines, jet  engines, aerospace and military technology. The shelves in U.S. shops are  chock-full of Chinese products. Look where the main product brands are  produced. They are produced in China. But that does not mean that the United  States or Germany is a commodity-driven economy because, in addition to the  consumer market, there is the market for industrial goods, which is the most  important, strategic market. You cannot buy a nuclear reactor or a ship engine  in a supermarket.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRBTH: When will Russia be able to produce competitive consumer  goods for the world market and not cheap alternatives for domestic consumption?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eV.L.: This will not happen until we meet the demand on our domestic  market. At present, about half our imports are machines and equipment and at  least half of these are investment imports, that is, what becomes the fixed  assets of enterprises, production lines, robots and machine tools. We are  talking about billions of dollars here. This shows that the domestic market is  not saturated with high-tech products. Why should we sell abroad what we need  ourselves? Last year, car production in Russia reached a record high, yet we  are still importing millions of cars. Our shipyards have full order books for  years ahead and the demand for new ships is colossal. We set a record for plane  production last year but we still have a long way to go to renew the entire  fleet of planes. Russia has increased its technological exports 2.5-fold in the  last 10 years. There is demand on the market for our industrial lasers,  scanning microscopes, ship simulators, navigation equipment. We supply products  for Boeing and Airbus. We render software development services and many big  companies have design offices in Russia. We sell farm machinery. France has  bought several dozen of our Soyuz booster rockets, and so on. And Russia is, of  course, securely the second-biggest supplier of arms in the world.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRBTH: What things made in Russia do you use yourself?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eV.L: I do not buy goods proceeding from the &#8220;buy Russian&#8221; principle.  For me, it&#8217;s the price/quality ratio that matters. Luckily, our goods have an  edge on that.  They are better than the Chinese ones in the same price  range and they are cheaper than European goods in the same quality category.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"Title": "VTB to deal with crisis aftermath",
				"Author": "Nikita Dulnev, RBTH",
				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eIn 2007, VTB floated 22.5 percent of its shares by public subscription at 13.6 kopecks per share, raising over $7 billion from the flotation. The action, called a &#8220;people&#8217;s I.P.O.&#8221; was meant to give the Russian public a chance to invest in state companies and the issue proved extremely popular. However, in the crisis years that followed, the bank&#8217;s share price dropped by almost half, and is currently trading at 7 kopecks. Participants in the I.P.O., many of whom were novice or unsophisticated investors, were outraged and claimed they had fallen victim to fraud. Rumors of a possible buyback have appeared from time to time, but V.T.B. always dismissed the measure as economically unsound. However, during the Russia 2012 economic forum in February, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin recommended that VTB reconsider the subject. The bank then finally agreed to buy back shares from I.P.O. participants at the offering price. Few shareholders have managed to hold on this long; most of them have already sold the stock. V.T.B. estimated that the bank will have to repurchase less than 1 percent of its share capital at the cost of roughly half a billion dollars. Still, the buyback is likely to be a painful experience, said Alexander Lebedev, businessman and owner of the National Reserve Corporation. He expects V.T.B. to be swamped with claims, since third-party interests will likely surface along with complaints about the number of shares subject to the buyback and the form of compensation. V.T.B. Bank President Andrei Kostin, however, has announced that the odds of aggrieved shareholders winning any lawsuit against V.T.B. over the buyback scheme are extremely low. Prime Minister Putin welcomed the decision. &#8220;The management has arrived at a fair and morally balanced solution,&#8221; Putin said after the announcement, and minority shareholders have hailed the bank&#8217;s move. But major shareholders and partners appeared befuddled &#8211; first and foremost GDR holders, who are mostly foreign investors. But Bank of Russia Deputy Head Alexei Ulyukayev is sure that the misunderstanding will soon be overcome. &#8220;The fact is that the transaction has no material financial value, since half a billion dollars is by no means a significant amount for the bank&#8217;s capital or dividends,&#8221; Ulyukayev said. Rating agencies also do not predict that the buyback would have any negative impact on the bank. &#8220;These facts, although negative in essence, will have no material influence on the bank. Furthermore, VTB will be free to float the shares again later,&#8221; said Fitch analyst Alexander Danilov. And the bank is indeed planning to float some shares as well as partially transfer them to its top managers as a bonus, said Vladimir Tarachev, chairman of V.T.B.&#8217;s Shareholder Advisory Council. In making this decision, the bank rejected the premise of the initial I.P.O., saying that the idea of increasing the number of individual minority shareholders has been a failure. &#8220;Selling shares to the public directly is unreasonable, so I believe that the reduction of the number of individual shareholders through the proposed buyback is well justified,&#8221; Kostin said. He also emphasized that the proposed buyback was above all a move aimed at reinforcing the image of the bank&#8217;s brand by &#8220;alleviating the negative attitude towards V.T.B&#8221;. This step to build goodwill, however, will most likely have negative consequences, said Alexander Khandruyev, head of the consulting group Banking, Finance, Investment. &#8220;This PR campaign is doing VT.B. a disservice. After all, it amounts to the bank admitting its own failure and inefficiency. There&#8217;s no talk of reimbursing minority shareholders for lost profits, although almost every one of them withdrew money from bank accounts, where it had been generating interest, in order to buy shares. In the four years since the flotation, bank account balances have increased by a factor of 1.5, or even more.&#8221; Meanwhile, many experts are positive that the expected buyback is hardly financially motivated. More likely, it is a pre-election maneuver by Vladimir Putin, who is running for president. &#8220;This is obviously pure politics, part of the Prime Minister&#8217;s performance ahead of the election,&#8221; Leonid Slipchenko, banking analyst at Uralsib Capital, said. Chairman of the Board of Otkritie Bank Yevgeny Dankevich, however, is certain that there are market reasons behind the move as well. According to him, the buyback &#8220;combines business with pleasure&#8221;. He says, &#8220;On the whole, buybacks are, if economically feasible, a normal practice. In the current situation, when banking shares are cheap, it may be the right thing to do. On the other hand, it is also clearly a good election campaign move.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eExemplifying the invest-in-Russia trend is Tiger Global Management, a New York-based international investment management firm. Over the past two years Tiger has invested twice in the Russian e-commerce platform Wikimart.ru &#8211; $5 million in 2010 and another $7 million in 2011 &#8211; and contributed $10 million in a round of financing for online travel sales site Anywayanyday.ru. Tiger also has shares in Russian search giant Yandex, which began trading on the NASDAQ in May 2011, and at one time held a stake in Mail.ru, a leading email service and portal. Another example is the whopping $55 million financing round for private shopping club KupiVip.ru last April, in which U.S. venture fund Bessemer Venture Partners played a notable part. Also of note is the rise of Ostrovok.ru, a clone of Booking.com, which received $13.6 million last July from western funds and business angels such as Zyngo founder Mark Pincus, early Facebook investor Peter Thiel and Skype founder Niklas Zennstr&#246;m, among others. Ostrovok had been co-founded a year earlier by Serge Faguet, a Russian-born entrepreneur and Stanford Business School graduate. Before creating Ostrovok.ru, Faguet worked as an analyst at Google, then founded TokBox, a video communication startup based in the Valley. Russia\u0027s new appeal comes as a logical consequence of the fast growth of its innovation-led markets. Almost unknown in the country in the late 90s, the Internet is now used by almost one Russian in two &#8211; and is still growing fast. Last September the country overtook Germany as Europe\u0027s largest market in terms of number of Internet users. \"There has been a lot of enthusiasm among U.S. funds for taking elements of successful e-commerce and social networking companies in one geography and transplanting them into another geography &#8211; first, in China, now increasingly in Russia,\" said Mac Elatab, an investment analyst at TrueBridge Capital Partners. \"With a GDP-per-capita growth of around 13 percent annually from 1999 through 2010, Russian consumers have money to spend.\"\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClosing the gap in entrepreneurial spirit\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAnother appealing factor is the r&#233;putation of Russia\u0027s science and technology industries. \"In computer science and materials science, the Russians are as good or better than anyone in the world,\" said Bill Reichert, Managing Director of Garage Technology Ventures, a major U.S. venture fund chasing Russian startups. In terms of entrepreneurship, progress has been remarkable over the past 10 years &#8211; with a scent of northern California now wafting in the Moscow air. \"Both Silicon Valley and Russia have extremely smart people who are working to create innovative opportunities globally,\" said Court Coursey, Managing Partner at Eric Schmidt\u0027s Tomorrow Ventures. Silicon Valley v&#233;t&#233;ran Steve Blank, who took part in a dozen of educational events in Moscow and St. Petersburg last year, agreed. \"I found very insightful people who match the best in California for sure.&#8221; Labor costs are another reason for high tech investors to come to Russia. Salaries are high in Moscow startups, but in a city like Tomsk, in Siberia &#8211; where every fourth inhabitant is either a student, a researcher, a university teacher or an employee of the Russian Academy of Sciences &#8211; a modest $2,500 per month, or even less, can prove enough to attract the cream of the crop among local engineers. Another positive factor differentiating Russia today from the era of the 1990s and early 2000s is government support for foreign and domestic investment in private equity. This support goes well beyond words: at the federal and regional levels, the Russian state is investing tens of billion of dollars in innovation. With its massive subsidies and tax cuts for innovative projects, Skolkovo, the giant tech hub outside Moscow now nearing completion, has attracted dozens of global venture funds and high tech firms. IT Park, near Kazan, stands as one of the largest technoparks in Eastern Europe, while the Tomsk special economic zone has attracted a number of domestic and international tech companies, including Nokia Siemens Networks, Korea\u0027s Darim International and the U.S.-based firms Monsoon Multimedia and Rovi Corporation. Direct state financing is also provided through an institution called the Russian Venture Company, a fund of funds that has launched no fewer than 12 high tech funds in Russia and abroad. State funding comes in addition to a dramatic increase in available Russian and foreign venture capital. While fewer than two dozen funds were actually operating in the country just three years ago, there is now more money in Moscow than in many other innovation spots on the global map. Blank described the funding situation as: \"The biggest pile of money I have ever seen.&#8221; Avi Hersh, a U.S. private equity investor who began investing in Russia in the 1990s, said: \"This comes as a sharp contrast with the early 90s, when it was next to impossible to identify capital for a startup. As more young Russian enterprises are funded, then merged or acquired, it will produce more success stories, which in turn will provide more funding for the next round of qualified startups.&#8221; Russia&#8217;s start-up industry has some problems, though. One of these is thoroughness. In a country without long traditions of entrepreneurship, Russian businessmen do not always present mature projects. \"We sometimes see very raw startups, lacking sound business models or business plans or with weak management teams,\" said Marina Kuznetsova of BV Capital, a venture fund operating from San Francisco and Hamburg. Russia is considered less attractive by many venture capitalists than other BRIC countires. The reasons for this include the country\u0027s small population compared with China or India and its location &#8211;  Moscow works at a 12-hour time difference from California. Language can also be an issue, as relatively few Russians speak fluent business-level English. Russia still has a serious image issue as well. \"Media coverage from Russia is almost uniformly negative in the U.S.,&#8221; said Elatab. &#8220;That is not to say that only negative things are happening in Russia &#8211; the truth is somewhere in the middle. At bottom, I think the Cold War still impacts how both Russians and Americans view each other.\"\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCan Russian innovation be spared corruption?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRussia\u0027s corruption and frequent breaches of rule of law are the greatest deterrent in the eyes of many foreigners. \"The economic system seems to be driven by political acceptance instead of predictable rules,\" said Blank. \"So many entrepreneurs have told me they have no guarantee that what they are starting is what they will keep.\" This makes looking ahead difficult. In Blank&#8217;s estimation: &#8220;How can Russia have an innovation future in such conditions? When a new wave of startups began developing in the Silicon Valley 30 years ago, there was never a discussion of such things.\" \"Russia has to fix this critical government issue,&#8221; Blank added. &#8221;Otherwise the brightest part of Russian entrepreneurs and engineers will leave the country. Other investors offer more nuanced perceptions. Esther Dyson, a U.S. investment angel who has invested in 15 Russian startups as well as in Yandex, has said that she has never witnessed any serious threat from aggressive Russian businessmen or corrupt Russian courts. Gleb Davidyuk of the Russian venture fund iTech Capital agreed: \"In the digital sphere, greedy civil servants don&#8217;t know what to look for &#8211; or where. This helps the industry stay below various radar screens.\" Adrien Henni is editor-in-chief for East-West Digital News.

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAfter his daughter was born in 2002, Maxim Dyachkov discovered the thing he really hated about taking care of the baby was putting on her tights &#8211; which are an absolute necessity for children in Russia. &#8220;My wife managed pretty well, but I could never get hold of my baby girl&#8217;s legs,&#8221; said Dyachkov. So Dyachkov came up with his own tactic: He turned the tights inside out and painted eyes on the socks &#8211; now the tights looked exactly like two puppets. The next thing to do was to play the puppeteer and tell his daughter various stories; putting on tights became a game. But the idea of producing unique children&#8217;s tights came to life only in 2006. Before that, Dyachkov had worked as a masseur and exercise therapy instructor at a children\u0027s medical center and then deputy head of non-commercial operations at Rosevrobank. He applied for an industrial patent to make tights with eyes on the inside, but he could not decide if he really wanted to register a business. Then Dyachkov met his old friend Dmitry Serebryakov at a party and they decided to go into business together. They had 450,000 rubles ($15,000) in savings between them, and they invested this money in developing the design of the tights. They established a business called &#8220;Lap&#8217;n&#8217;cap.&#8221; Dyachkov and Serebryakov placed their first $10,000 order for 5,000 pairs of tights with the Textilnaya Manufactura textile factory in Sergiev Posad, outside Moscow. &#8220;That was a failure,&#8221; said Dyachkov, explaining that the tights were made of poor fabric and they shrank and faded when washed. &#8220;Before we supplied our tights to stores, we checked them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When I washed pink tights with my wife&#8217;s white bra, it turned pink. Sales were out of the question.&#8221; The businessmen went looking for another manufacturer, and this time and chose Duna-Vesta, a Ukrainian producer. &#8220;They were ready to meet all our requirements, except for one &#8211; they could not make eyes on the inside of the tights. We had regular tights, socks and long socks made at Duna-Vesta for almost four years,&#8221; Dyachkov said.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe eyes have it\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe two businessmen never gave up on their idea of puppet-tights and eventually they found a Russian printing house that promised to print eyes on tights. &#8220;Yet that, too, was a failure,&#8221; Dyachkov said. &#8220;They damaged almost a quarter of the batch. When the tights went through the dryer, the workers set the wrong temperature and threads on the inside of the tights melted.&#8221; Finally, the men met representatives of Lateks at the Textillegprom expo and signed a five-year contract with the Turkish firm in January 2011. &#8220;This company is capable of making tights and printing eyes on the inside,&#8221; Serebryakov said. In 2008, even as the economy sank into recession, the company reported a turnover of $2 million; this grew to $2.5 million in 2009 and $3 million in 2010. Now Lap&#8217;n&#8217;cap tights, socks and long socks are available not only through Moscow retail networks, but also in the Russian regions. Wholesalers account for about 20 percent of all sales. Serebraykov and Dyachkov wanted to expand their business, and they invested $80,000 in making patterned socks in bright colors for adults. But the new socks sold poorly. &#8220;In Europe, men easily wear socks with colored stripes, but our people are more conservative and prefer black socks,&#8221; Serebryakov said. So the entrepreneurs took a new tactic &#8211; they opened an office in New York. The first consignment of Lap&#8217;n&#8217;cap tights with eyes arrived in the United States in October 2011. The tights are now available through two small children&#8217;s retail chains in Jersey City and New York. &#8220;We managed to make a contract with Amazon and we are watching our tights go to all states, even California, Texas and Florida, where it is always hot and children do not seem to wear tights at all,&#8221; Dyachkov said. Their business partner in the United States is actress Irina Shmeleva, who emigrated to the U.S. in the late 1990s. She owns her own marketing firm via3pr on Madison Avenue and helps the Russian company promote their Lap&#8217;n&#8217;cap brand in the U.S. market. &#8220;In America, everything is much cheaper &#8211; the rent of a 100-square meter warehouse is only $500, whereas in Russia it is at least $1,000,&#8221; Serebryakov said. &#8220;We order some of the services &#8211; photo shoots and videos with children, packaging design and catalogue &#8211; exclusively from America now.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis text is abridged from the original, which appeared in Vedomosti.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe Russian instant payments operator Qiwi has put into service  a series of terminals that will distribute packages to consumers. The postal  kiosks are vying with courier and ordinary postal services for the attention of  the increasing number of Russians shopping online. &#8220;We want to cut down our last mile expenses, which are incurred  at the most cost-intensive stage of the logistics chain, when goods are handed  over to the client. One terminal can do the work of several deliverymen,&#8221; said  Andreas Pregowski, the C.E.O. of Qiwi Post. The new company was founded jointly  by three partners: Poland&#8217;s Integr.Pl, the iTech Capital investment fund and  Qiwi. Andrey Romanenko, Qiwi&#8217;s C.E.O., is the founder and owner of both Qiwi  and ITech. The Qiwi Post terminals make it possible for online buyers to  pick up their orders themselves, using personal identification numbers. The  terminals allow online shops to cut their costs by up to 20 percent, while  other types of long-distance sales outlets such as catalogue companies and  network marketing firms can lower their shipping times. In Moscow, Qiwi Post  has already installed several dozen metal lockers equipped with drawers of  various sizes and cash acceptors, and intends to commission an additional 400  units in 2012. The company plans to invest $30 million in the project over  three years. QIwi&#8217;s interest in this market is its connection with the  company&#8217;s core business &#8211; payment processing services, which it provides to a  number of clients, including online shops. The regional development of Qiwi  Post will be promoted by Qiwi partner network companies operating payment  terminals. Qiwi Post is not the only player in this market, however. PickPoint  and Logibox launched approximately 200 automated postal kiosks throughout the  country last year, with the overall market capacity estimated at 3,000 to 6,000  units. PickPoint forecasts indicate that postal kiosks will be serving 15 to 20  percent of all business-to-consumer dispatches in the near future. Vladimir Solodkin, C.E.O. of the Spsr-Express delivery service,  indicated that last mile logistics &#8211; the final stage of goods handover  from seller to buyer &#8211; accounts for 30  percent of total shipping costs. Self-service postal kiosks make delivery  cheaper by reducing last mile issues. Each courier can cut time and fuel  consumption by taking several parcels at a time to the terminal he or she  serves, following the same standard route. Moreover, delivery recipients turn  down 10 to 12 percent of all parcels delivered personally in Russia, where the  vast majority of online purchase are C.O.D., while self-service terminals  demonstrate a significantly lower rejection rate of 3 percent. Market players  believe this phenomenon ensues from the great degree of convenience connected  with returning a parcel directly to the delivery person. There is no doubt that price plays a role for both buyers and  sellers. Often a buyer will chose to pick up an order from a sales outlet  directly to avoid shipping costs altogether. The price benefits of automated  parcel terminals are not so great as picking up directly from the seller, but  they are cheaper. A buyer generally saves 10 percent on shipping costs by using  an automated terminal rather than a delivery service. For their part, online retail outlets can save 20 percent on  shipping if they deliver their goods to a parcel collection terminal instead of  using courier services. &#8220;The price our partners pay should be significantly  lower than that for courier delivery but it can be higher than the cost of  ordinary postal services, since our system makes use of courier services, too,&#8221;  said Andreas Petrowski. Tatiana Lyubimova, head of DHL Global Mail Russia explained: &#8220;Part  of the delivery costs is transferred to the clients, so we can often obtain a  certain reduction in costs.&#8221; Convenience is also an issue. Automated parcel terminals are  most popular in off-hours, when some express delivery services do not work.  According to Qiwi Post estimates, 37 percent of clients in Europe pick up their  deliveries from self-service between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. PickPoint clients in  Russia collect 34 percent of all parcels from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. Additionally,  automated postal terminals eliminate the need for personal contact between  couriers and clients. The very possibility of skipping this stage and enjoying  independence from delivery personnel is seen by clients as a major advantage. Intimshop  which sells sex toys and other intimate goods, delivers 25 percent of its  purchases through self-service terminals in cities where they are available,  whereas the average online store delivers between 8 and 10 percent of purchases  this way, according to PickPoint estimates.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirst published in the Expert magazine. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRussia is  poised to become the largest e-commerce market in Europe  by 2019, if it maintains its current pace of growth. In September 2011, Russia overtook Germany as the European country  with the most Internet users. There are now 50.8 million Russians online, and  in a December 2011 poll half of Russian urbanites said that they used the  Internet at least once a day. The growth of Russia&#8217;s online  audience combined with the country&#8217;s vast territory and underdeveloped retail  sector makes it ideal for online shopping. Websites are the simplest and  cheapest way for retailers based in Moscow  to reach the far corners of the country. Russia became the  second-largest e-commerce market in Europe in  2009. At that time, the online marketplace was reponsible for $19 billion in  sales, according to Troika Dialog. Since then, e-commerce has been growing by  between 22 percent and 30 percent a year, and is expected to continue this pace  in 2012. That year, Data Insight estimates the market will be worth $12.6  billion. As in other sectors Russia  will still have to work hard to overtake Germany, the European leader in  e-commerce, which had $27.5 billion in sales in 2011, according to  e-commercefacts.com, and continues to grow at 17 percent a year. Industry investment will play a key role in achieving such high growth rates.  Marina Treshchova, CEO of Fast Lane Ventures (FLV), one of Russia&#8217;s leading tech funds, said that the first  round of venture capital (VC) money is arriving in Russia&#8217;s e-commerce sector, and  that volumes invested into the industry last year were doubled from a year  earlier. But Russia  is still an exotic destination for most venture capitalists. &#8220;There are few big VC funds interested in Russia,  but there is a ground swell of smaller VC based in Europe  that is much more active,&#8221; said Treshchova. But Fast Lane has already done several deals and has 16 Internet companies  running or in development. The most successful is KupiVIP.ru which is already  the largest online shop in Russia  offering high-end goods to the emerging middle class. The company&#8217;s revenues  went grew to $120 million in only three years. &#8220;We develop our own companies, but increasingly we are also getting other  people bringing us their companies. We give them seed capital to develop the  business, then help them to raise more financing when they get a bit bigger,&#8221;  Treshchova said. One of her most recent deals raised $50 million from European venture funds for  Heverest.ru, an online store offering outdoor and sports equipment. The site  targets hikers, climbers and those with a disposable income who are interested  in a healthy lifestyle. &#8220;The amount of money available from investors in Europe  is limited, but the interest is definitely growing,&#8221; Treshchova said. The most dynamic part of the business is online advertising, where ad buys are  growing faster than in the more traditional media. Analysts at Troika Dialog  estimate the overall ad spend this year will remain flat compared to that in  2011. But within a year, they estimate that advertisers will enjoy double-digit  growth. Estimates suggest that Internet ads should experience growth of more than 33  percent over the next few years. This growth will come at the expense of  television advertising, which will see growth slow to abour 16 percent, according  to Troika Dialog. The next big thing will be advertising on mobile platforms .  This market is just now starting to gather momentum. &#8220;Although the level of penetration of mobile internet in Russia is currently  low, at less than 10 percent, it is growing rapidly,&#8221; said David Ferguson, an  analyst with Renaissance Capital, who added that all the major Russian firms  are now rolling out new mobile applications and services to tap this new  market.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eIn 2011, advertisers in Russia spent 263.4   billion rubles ($8.8 billion) for promotions, up 21 percent over 2010   and 4 percent over 2008, according to a new report by the Association of   Communications Agencies of Russia. For the first time, online   advertising outperformed print ads, making it Russia&#8217;s second-largest   media market after TV. Online advertising grew by 56 percent, while   spending on print ads rose by only 6 percent. Television remains the primary national media platform, taking in   half of all ad spending. However, according to industry experts, the   dominance of TV has actually advanced the growth of the online market.   Andrei Chernyhov, CEO of AdWatch, said that TV ad capacities were sold   out in the first months of 2011, prompting some key advertisers to   increase online spending. This led to a 15 percent price increase at   major online platforms and in some months, the demand for online   placement exceeded the supply, he said. Lev Gleiser, head of Yandex   media products development, said that concentration is increasing in the   market and that major platforms increasingly control more ad spending   on the Internet. Ad sales also increased in volume due to continued growth in the   number of Internet users in Russia and the amount of time these users   spend online, said Alexei Katkov, commercial director of the Mail.ru   Group. According to market research firm TNS, the monthly Russian online   audience in December 2011 was 37.1 million users, up 5.4 percent over   December 2010. An increase in online advertising was particularly noticeable in   certain sectors, the most important of which was major fast-moving   consumer goods (FMCG) companies, according to Alexei Belyaev, head of   ATSVI online research. Companies engaged in e-commerce and services have   also become prominent advertisers, Chernyshov added. He and Katkov   cited Tinkoff Credit Systems (TCS) as an example. Oleg Anisimov, TCS   vice president for marketing, confirmed that the bank has significantly   increased its online spending. &#8220;We have no offline offices, so we spend   online more than any other media.&#8221; To promote its services among the   less active audience and build the TCS brand, the bank uses outdoor   advertising, Anisimov said. This year, the market for Internet advertising will show on average   &#8220;slight growth,&#8221; according to Katkov, but Chernyshov forecasts that   online ad spending will grow by 35 to 40 percent. Ilya Perekopsky,   deputy CEO of Russian social networking giant VKontakte expects an   increase of 1.5 times, if no major crisis hits the market.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirst published in Vedomosti.ru\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The rich get  richer and the poor get poorer. This is of course very dangerous, because when  the inequality reaches a certain limit, it leads to dissatisfaction among  people and as a result to revolts or even revolutions. Growing inequality means  the lack of justice and Russian people attach great importance to justice. That  is why we have a very tense situation in the Russian society at the  moment. Another very important problem for the Russian economy is its low  efficiency, expressed particularly in low labor productivity. This means that  an average worker in Russia produces a lot fewer goods than the average worker  in Germany or in the U.S. It happens not because we are lazier than people in  Western Europe and America, but since we have inefficient capital and inefficient  equipment and moreover the whole organization of work in our country is very  inefficient. Here is a good example. It takes usually about 18 months to build  an ordinary house. For an average construction company in Russia, it is  technically possible to build a house within 18 months, but it needs two or  three years to get all the permissions for the construction. In the end, it  takes three to five years to build a house in Russia, while in Western Europe  you need two years.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat do you think of  the modernization ideology that is being promoted by Russian President Dmitry  Medvedev?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eThis policy seems to be the right one. We really need to modernize  our economy just like the most developed countries of the world do, but in  practice, modernization is just a beautiful slogan. People in Russia do not  understand what modernization really is. Or, to be more precise, everyone  understands modernization in his own way. We have already had lots of beautiful  slogans in the history of Russia. In the Khrushchev era for example, we had: &#8220;We  will soon live under communism&#8221;, in the Gorbachev era, &#8220;Perestroika will solve  all our problems.&#8221; &#8220;Modernization&#8221; is just one of these beautiful slogans that is  good to use in different speeches, but what it really is &#8211; people do not know.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFrom your point  of view, how could Russia end its dependence on oil and gas?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe main question is: &#8220;Why is it just the oil and gas sector that  is developing in Russia?&#8221; The answer is: &#8220;Because there is a demand for that.  The whole world wants our oil and gas.&#8221; What else do we have to offer the  world? We used to have a very strong military sector. Now we build many fewer  military products than before, but I believe we still have great potential in  this field. Also, countries of the Third World today have a high demand for  floating nuclear power plants. The Third World lacks nuclear power, but  building a power plant there would take a lot of time and money. Nobody except  us can build atomic icebreakers. We could create floating nuclear power plants  and sell them to the countries of the Third World. Russia, the Russian mentality and Russian workers have one  peculiarity: We can produce small amounts of goods or single products of very  high quality, but we are not skillful at producing large quantities of goods. We  do not organize mass-production properly. Floating nuclear power plants are  single products and in this field we could succeed. We can make science-intensive  single products that other countries need. I believe it is a good way of  getting rid of oil and gas dependence.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow can we solve  the problem of income inequality in Russia?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eIt will take a lot of effort to get rid of it. First of all, we  need a new tax system. At the moment, rich people in our country pay the same  taxes as poor people, although they should of course pay a lot more. The land  tax and the real estate tax are extremely low in Russia. In the suburbs of  Moscow you can find lots of huge luxury mansions that cost hundreds of millions  of dollars while the tax rates for them are very low. But the most important thing is to give people an opportunity to  find their way in life. Those who live in little towns and villages in Russia  do not have any opportunities at all. Many very talented people really do not  know where they could express themselves. We should create these opportunities  and for this purpose we need the support of our government.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAccording to  Transparency International, the level of corruption in Russia is a lot higher  than in Western Europe. Do you think it is possible to solve this problem?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eI believe this is a problem that can be solved. The reason of an  extremely high level of corruption in Russia is from my point of view quite  obvious. In Germany or the U.S., the strongest segment of society is the  cluster of entrepreneurs, those who earn money and build the economy. In  Russia, by contrast, the strongest social segment nowadays is the cluster of  bureaucrats. At the moment they are the most important people in this country. If a bureaucrat earns a fixed salary, then the only way for him to  get rich is to steal. Russian bureaucrats are highly qualified in this field.  Moreover, the laws in our country stimulate corruption. You can solve any problem  if you bribe a bureaucrat. Just like in my example with the house. In order to  build a house you first need to spend three years getting various permissions  from different clerks. What we really need is a system of equal rights for all segments  of society: for scientists, bureaucrats, military people, etc. If they all get  equal rights, then there will be no such problems in our country. But for that  we need a big reconstruction of our society. One more way to fight corruption is to create transparency. Every  joint-stock company should show its budget not only to its shareholders, but  also to everyone else. Then it will be a lot more difficult to steal. This  requires of course a lot of time and money, but in my opinion it is the best  way to fight corruption.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDo you believe  economics can help solve the main problems of the Russian economy?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eYes, of course! This is exactly the purpose of economics. But  modern economics is unfortunately too one-sided. The most influential  economists today are all experts on market economies. If you take a look at  Nobel Prize winners in Economics since 1967 you will see that they are all specialists  in market economies. Where in the modern world do we have market economies? In  the United States, Western Europe, Singapore, Japan and in some other states.  And the rest of the planet &#8211; these 4 or 5 billion people have totally different  economic models. Even such a super developed country as the United Arab  Emirates is not a market economy. They have an economic model that is different  from those described in modern textbooks. Even banks in this country work in a  different way.\u003c/t\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat are the  main advantages and disadvantages of Russia&#8217;s entry into the WTO?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e  \u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003eRussia&#8217;s entry into the WTO is in my opinion a rather  controversial issue since I see there some definite advantages and some  definite disadvantages for us. In some fields we get advantages, for example,  in the automotive industry. In some fields we get only disadvantages, for  instance, in agriculture. I find China&#8217;s policy regarding its WTO entry very  wise. They joined the WTO a long time ago but with lots of different  restraints. And Russia is ready even before its entry into the WTO to fulfill  all their requirements. I believe this is wrong and somehow even insults our  national pride. An entry just for entry&#8217;s sake should not be our aim.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat do you  think, is there anything that we should borrow from other countries of the  world and adopt here in Russia?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003e believe the most  important thing that we should borrow from other countries of the world is a  right distribution of power between different levels of governance. We have  several levels of governance in Russia. These are municipalities, federal  subjects and so on. In Germany, for example, federated states have a lot more  authority than our municipalities. In Russia, everything is managed at the  federal level, even courts and the police. It leads to a suppression of  initiative from below. That is why young people in the Russian provinces do not  have any opportunities in life. They just have nowhere to go.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eWith an average of 300 sunny  days a year, Altai has more in common with the Black Sea coast than the  snow-and-ice-covered permafrost that come to mind with the mention of &#8220;Siberia.&#8221;  Altai has a strong agricultural tradition, and Karlin decided the region could  specialize in making cheese. The success of the cheese project &#8211; Altai is now the  second-largest cheese producer in Siberia and the home of the world&#8217;s largest  wheel of cheese &#8211; brought the territory into contact with cheesemakers in  France&#8217;s Franche-Comt&#233; region. As the Siberians worked more closely with the  French, they learned that in France, where there is cheese, there is wine. And  so the idea of making wine in Altai came into being. It was not the first time the idea had been considered. Altai&#8217;s climate  is very good for growing fruit, and during the Soviet era, government factories  produced alcoholic beverages from chokeberry and apples in the region, although  they weren&#8217;t very good. During the anti-alcohol campaign begun in the late  1980s under Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev, the local winery was an easy  target for closure. Nevertheless, locals had long grown hardy Siberian grapes to  make juice and mooshine, so the local authorities knew grapes would grow in the  territory. In 2009, 600 vines of classic French grapes such as Merlot and  Chardonnay were planted in the territory. The transplants were supplied by the  Guillaume family company, which has produced planting stock since 1895. Company  director Xavier Guillaume, who is also the president of the winemaking  syndicate of Franche-Comt&#233;, personally visited Altai to oversee the planting of  the vines. The first Altai winery was small &#8211; just 3 hectares. During the  first summer, the vines grew very well, but both the Siberians and the French  were concerned that the vines would not survive the winter. When the spring  returned, it was clear which varietals would be good for the region. &#8220;Pinot Noir and Chardonnay naturalized in Siberia, but white  Muscat dies, so we will have to give up on it,&#8221; said Vladimir Vagner, head of  the AltaiSpirtProm corporation, which supervises Altai winemaking. Vagner noted  that the Siberians learned from that first winter how best to winterize the  vines. In 2010, the vineyard was expanded to 12,000 transplants, and at the end  of that winter, 85 percent of the vines had survived, despite the fact that  there was little snow to insulate the plants and the temperatures were very  cold. French specialists warned the Siberians that the vines would  bear fruit properly only in the summer of 2012, but the harvest of Fall 2011 proved  sufficient to make half a ton of wine. Experts attributed the results to the exceptional  fertility of the Altai soil. &#8220;The wine is maturing now; the indicators are very good,&#8221; said  Viktor Korshunov, head of the Altai District, which is part of the Altai  Territory. Now Altai is working to educate its own winegrowers. Over the  last two years, students in the fermentation industry technology department at  Altai State Technical University have been trained at the Domain Beau Pere et  Fils company and the Agricultural College in Montmorot, France. The  workshops of the old Altai Winery have been reconstructed and new equipment has  been procured, including 220-liter barrels brought from Europe in which the  wine will mature. Next year, when the grape harvest is expected to reach 30 tons,  Altaiskaya loza wine made from French grape varieties will be available for  tasting.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"Author": "Roman Golubev, Rosinvest.com",
				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eDuring the Soviet era, 25 jewelry  manufacturers met the demand of the entire country for precious stones and  metals. Today, there are more than 4,500 jewelry makers in Russia,  employing some 150,000 people in one of the country&#8217;s most high-tech sectors. From  2001 to the beginning of the global financial crisis, the jewelry industry in Russia showed  stable growth, efficiently combining long-established traditions and reliable  sources of raw materials. The industry reported an average 30 percent annual  growth rate for most of the 2000s. In 2011, Russia ranked fifth in the world in  the production of gold jewelry and 12th in that of gemstone pieces. Nevertheless the past two years have been  difficult ones for the Russian jewelry sector. Prices for precious stones and  metals have increased dramatically. Gold prices rose from $1,000 per ounce to  $1,800 and diamond prices from $66 to $124 per carat. This increase in costs  combined with an overall reduction in disposable income for ordinary Russians has  forced major manufacturers to cut costs. Overall jewelry production is down 30  percent, and the average weight of items sold has been reduced from 3.7 grams to 1.4 grams, a result of  the shift in consumer demand towards cheaper items. These factors are common for jewelry  producers across the industry, but other issues are specific to the Russian  market. According to Farit Gumirov, general director of the Almaz-Holding  jewelry company, one factor impeding the development of the domestic jewelry  sector is the Russian taxation system. Importers of raw materials, including  gold, precious stones and high-tech equipment have to pay high customs duties, a  profit tax and the value-added tax (VAT) in order to bring goods into Russia.  Although this tax is later refunded, it takes needed capital away from  production. Additionally, all finished items must be securely transported to an  assessment office so they can receive a special government stamp. Providing  both the security and the transportation increases costs that then must be  added into the price of the product, which makes Russian-made jewelry  uncompetitive with foreign-made items. An additional problem is the increasing  amount of inexpensive foreign jewelry coming into the Russian market. Experts believe  that imports from countries such as China,  Thailand, India and Turkey  now account for about 35 percent of all jewelry sold in Russia. Given  the low manufacturing costs in those countries, even assuming the price of the  imported items is tripled by customs duties, they are cheaper than Russian-made  pieces. Russia&#8217;s  accession to the WTO and the subsequent reduction in customs fees will further  decrease the competitiveness of Russian products. To minimize their losses, Russian producers  are now signing contracts with companies in Southeast Asia to export Russian  raw materials to Asian factories for the creation of pieces that later return  to Russia  as finished jewelry. Russian jewelry makers have also proposed a  set of measures to increase the competitiveness of Russian products on the  domestic market, including the cancellation of import taxes on precious stones  and the abolition of the VAT on the sale of precious metals in ingots. In addition, in order to prevent illegal  jewelry imports and level the playing field for Russian manufacturers, the Russian  Association of Jewelers has proposed a special stamp for imported jewelry,  which will be required for the sale of items in Russia. According to Vadim Yachmenikhin, the chairman  of the jeweler&#8217;s association, this policy could increase both the amount of  gold included in jewelry and boost retail sales.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirts published in Rosinvest.com.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe  failures that plagued the Russian space industry in 2011 have not caused the  Russian space agency Roskosmos to abandon its plans for the full deployment of  the GLONASS system &#8211; a satellite-based navigation system that will serve as an  alternative to the U.S. GPS system. The complete GLONASS satellite system is  already in place, but in the coming years maintenance and development costs are  expected to rise sharply. From 2001 to 2011, implementation of the federal  target program for GLONASS development cost 107 billion rubles ($4 billion),  but from 2012 to 2020, these costs will soar to 347 billion rubles ($11  billion). More  than 280 billion ($9 billion) of this will be used to upgrade the satellites.  There are plans to launch 35 new, modernized GLONASS satellites over the  eight-year period. After this, however, the maintenance costs should drop. The  modernized satellites are projected to last between five and seven years longer  than the older versions. In  addition to the satellite modernization, upgrades are also planned on the  ground. Ground-based differential correction stations and three relay  satellites on the geostationary orbit will substantially boost its precision.  This complex will help improve positioning precision by providing additional  information. By 2020, positioning precision should be 0.6 meters or better,  compared to 0.7 meters for the GPS system. Sixteen positioning ground stations  are under construction in Russia and in the Antarctic at the Russian bases  Bellinshausen and Novolazarevskaya. According to plans, new stations will be constructed  from Brazil to Indonesia, covering the entire southern hemisphere and giving  the Russian system a foothold in the region.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eLike  GPS, the GLONASS system was originally intended for military application and  discussions of its transition to commercial use began only recently. The first  real GLONASS-capable civilian devices appeared at the end of 2009, but so far  the technology has proven to be commercially viable. In 2011, navigation  operator NIS GLONASS reported 3.3 billion rubles ($110 million) in revenues &#8211;  4.5 times more than in 2010. The development of projects associated with  satellite navigation will only increase revenues, and Alexander Gurko, general  director of NIS GLONASS is optimistic about the creation of such projects. &#8220;From  this year on, regional target programs for GLONASS development will become  additional growth drivers. They have already been approved in 15 regions of the  Russian Federation. In another 46, the following projects are under  development: equipment of public transport with navigation and  telecommunication tools and establishment of systems for remedying the damage  done by heavy transport to federal and regional roads,&#8221; Gurko said. Most  of the regional programs being developed to take advantage of GLONASS focus on  use by the general public, such as improving the punctuality of public  transport and controlling the movement of freight vehicles and taxis to modify  traffic flow. Other projects will have to wait until the system becomes more  precise. Eventually, GLONASS will be suitable for monitoring the state of  oscillation-prone capital structures, such as bridges and high-rise buildings.  A precise navigation system will be able to detect such oscillations and warn  the appropriate control centers in case of dangerous movements. Devices using  signals from the satellite system will be installed on the new bridges being  built in Vladivostok for the APEC Summit in 2012. But  GLONASS is not transitioning completely to civilian use. In the coming years  several projects with military applications will also come online, including  the introduction of satellite-guided ammunition into mass production and  development of the ESU TZ, a tactical-level C2 system.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eIn 1992, amid the chaos of economic shock therapy,  a group of engineers at a struggling defense plant in the city of Chelyabinsk saw the  opportunity to apply its skills in the newly formed free market. The result was  Metran, currently one of Russia&#8217;s  largest producers of measuring transmitters and home to American technology  giant Emerson&#8217;s Global   Engineering Center.  Metran employs over 1,000 people and, as owner of hundreds of Russian and  international engineering patents, follows the motto &#8220;international quality at  a Russian price.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eUnfortunately, most of Chelyabinsk&#8217;s metallurgical and  defense-oriented factories did not make such a smooth transition to the free  market. Industrial decay, outdated infrastructure, pollution and monotowns &#8212;  cities that are economically dependent on a single factory &#8212; are major problems  for the whole of Russia,  but seem especially acute in the Chelyabinsk Region. Located 1,000 miles east of Moscow in the Ural Mountains separating Europe and Asia,  the city of Chelyabinsk  celebrated its 275th anniversary in 2011. During the Soviet era, parts of the  region were closed off from the outside world because large clusters of  tractor, weapons and metallurgical producers were concentrated there. Chelyabinsk also housed  some of the country&#8217;s most sophisticated nuclear weapons labs.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003ePrivatization and the economic chaos of the 1990s hit Chelyabinsk hard. As state defense orders  dried up, the city&#8217;s heavy industries suffered; its few civilian products could  not compete on the free market. By 1994, when foreigners were first allowed to  visit Chelyabinsk,  many factories had not been paying workers&#8217; salaries for months. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine there was only one hotel catering to foreigners in the  &#8217;90s,&#8221; said Dwight Bohm, an American executive who worked as general director  of Metran after the company was purchased by Emerson. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t buy a single  book to read in English in those days. Many people I met had clearly never seen  a foreigner before.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRussia&#8217;s 1998 financial  collapse was followed by an economic boom, which fueled demand for Chelyabinsk&#8217;s  metallurgical products and raw materials. This in turn led to the development  of a local service economy as stores, restaurants and boutiques sprung up to  meet demand. In 2010, President Dmitry Medvedev appointed 41-year-old lawmaker Mikhail  Yurevich as governor of the Chelyabinsk Region. In 1997, Yurevich was named Man  of the Year in Chelyabinsk  at the tender age of 28 for his managerial skills at a local agricultural  holding. The former businessman takes the public relations aspect of his new  job seriously, traveling to the U.S.,  Europe, China and Japan to court  investors. &#8220;We need a new industrialization in Chelyabinsk,  or, in modern parlance, we need to attract investments,&#8221; Yurevich said. &#8220;I&#8217;m  not just talking about setting up new factories, but modernizing the industrial  base. We have to catch up with developed economies.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eYurevich appointed Alexei Ovakimyan, 38, as his deputy for investment projects.  Before taking on the job, Ovakimyan founded a successful private consulting  company. &#8220;It was clear from most of our meetings with foreign investors that  they had never heard of Chelyabinsk  before. They didn&#8217;t even know we existed,&#8221; he said. Since 2008, the Chelyabinsk  region has managed to attract an average of $3 billion in direct foreign  investment annually, with a large chunk coming from Finnish energy giant Fortum  Corp, which has an ambitious investment and production program in the region. &#8220;I found the problem was not a lack of interest among international investors &#8212;  they&#8217;re actively looking for projects in emerging markets like ours. The  problem is a lack of creative ideas on our part,&#8221; said Ovakimyan. &#8220;No more than  10 percent of the proposals we&#8217;ve received from local entrepreneurs seeking to  attract capital were feasible.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe global financial crisis was another setback for Chelyabinsk&#8217;s factories and mills. The most  optimistic forecasts point to the region returning to its precrisis $23 billion  regional domestic product later this year. &#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do is take advantage of the production capacity and  facilities we already have instead of selling off plots of land for new  developments,&#8221; Ovakimyan said. Meanwhile, Metran&#8217;s factory in central Chelyabinsk  is already showing signs of preparation for a big 20th anniversary celebration  this year.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eInvestors have started 2012 bullish on  Russia - the country&#8217;s benchmark R.T.S. index was up 10.2 percent by Jan. 23 -  but analysts believe that the first half of the year will be difficult as  Europe continues to struggle with debt issues. &#8220;The markets are upbeat, for now,&#8221; said  Marcus Svedberg, chief economist at East Capital, the biggest retail fund  investing in Russia,  &#8220;and the consensus is for a good second half of the year. But things are  already starting to look pretty good.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eMany Russian brokerages believe that the R.T.S. index will keep within the  current range of 1,400&#8211;1,500 points until the end of 2012, reported Russian  journal Kommersant Dengi in the middle of January, due to an economic slowdown  in Europe externally and political turbulence  surrounding the March presidential election internally.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eBut the more optimistic observers believe these risks are overstated. Russia&#8217;s  biggest investment bank, Troika Dialog, which has just been taken over by  state-owned retail behemoth Sberbank, surprised Russia-watchers by revising its  end-of-year target up to 2,200   in the middle of January, which would mean a whopping 60  percent over the course of the year. Clearly, much depends on how well the rest  of Europe deals with its problems.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eSaid Chris Weafer, head of strategy at Troika Dialog, &#8220;If we get that  crisis-rebuild scenario in Europe and elsewhere, then the case for Russian  market out-performance in the second half of 2012 and into 2013 will be boosted  by the fact that the next government is expected to take a more proactive and  pragmatic route to improve investment in the economy.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAlex Kantarovich, an equity strategist with J.P. Morgan, agrees. &#8220;The Russian  market has outperformed other global emerging markets from the October trough  in spite of the political turbulence,&#8221; Kantarovich said. &#8220;This trend should  have long legs: Russia&#8217;s  discount to global emerging markets remains abnormal and may contract on easing  risk aversion and earning surprises [at companies].&#8221; Liam Halligan of Prosperity Capital Management (P.C.M.), the largest foreign  investor into Russia, said that investors are bored with sitting on the  sidelines on huge piles of cash and are starting to be tempted back into the  market by the bargains on offer; P.C.M. was one of the few funds in the world to  see a net inflow of new money in 2011, said Halligan; the company earned $300  million\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAlmost all investment banks working in Russia have the same strategy for 2012:  pick solid value stocks in the first half of the year, while investors are  still wary of risk. Power company E.On Russia and regional supermarket  chain Magnit are two of the most popular names in this category. Tactical  defensive stocks are those that pay high dividends, such as oil producer  Bashneft, or those in counter-cyclical sectors, like gold producer Polymetal. Then, as the economy starts to recover in the second half of 2012, investors  are widely expected to start buying growth stocks, favoring sectors such as  real estate, media, commodities and the Internet. Popular companies in this  category include C.T.C. Media, gas producer Novatek and search engine company  Yandex.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eSberbank is universally the top pick for growth among brokers. Despite the  slowdown, Russia&#8217;s  banks put in a record-breaking year for profits in 2011; Sberbank accounted for  most of the sector&#8217;s loan growth by itself. In general, Russia&#8217;s banks  are getting on with the job of rebuilding their businesses following the  setbacks of the last two years. Russia&#8217;s  oil pipeline monopolist, Transneft, is also being discussed as a good buy. The  company&#8217;s investment program is coming to an end, after which it will generate  billions of dollars in free cash flow, some of which the management said may be  paid out as dividends in an effort to boost its attractiveness ahead of a  possible privatization. Oleg Maximov, an oil and gas analyst with Troika Dialog, said, &#8220;We believe that  Transneft is the only stock in our sector where the expected returns could  realistically swell by several times over the next few years if management  sticks to their promise to reward shareholders.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eA.F.I. Development, a leading Russian developer, is another popular name. The  office real estate market in Russia has already clawed back most of its  pre-bubble gains, and there is a boom in warehouse construction as rents rise  on the back of high demand from Western importers hoping to tap Russia&#8217;s  burgeoning consumer goods sector. &#8220;We have recently increased our exposure to Russia for a number of reasons,&#8221;  said East Capital&#8217;s Svedberg. &#8220;Fears about a hard landing in China are  fading, while some of the work the E.U. did last year to contain the crisis is  bearing fruit. But really the overriding motive is Russia is by far the cheapest  market in the region with a large and growing consumer demand that will  continue to drive the growth.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRussian equity will also perform well at some point, as equity valuations have  rarely been this cheap. Currently the discount on Russian stocks compared to  the other members of the BRIC is around 50 percent, according to J.P. Morgan &#8212; much  cheaper than the usual 25&#8211;30 percent discount in normal times.  But perhaps the most telling indicator is the oil price implied by the equity  valuations: As Russia is heavily dependent on oil exports, the stock market  gains and losses tend to move in lock-step with the vagaries of the  international price of oil. In the boom years, Russian equities occasionally  got ahead of the price of oil, however, the current low index level implies an  oil price of $60 &#8212; way below the current price of about $100. In other words,  Russian stocks have priced in a full-scale crash of the European financial  system. Said Weafer, &#8220;Either the equity market is correct and oil isunsustainably high, or the equity market is trading with excessive fear. If the  former, the current market valuation already reflects an oil price fall; if the  latter, this is a good base for asset valuation recovery in the second half of 2012.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

At the same time, the number  of individual investors playing on the stock market independently increased 9.3  percent, according to RTS data.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eEconomist Denis Strebkov, an assistant  professor at the Higher School of Economics, believes that the percentage of  Russians who personally invest in the stock market does not exceed 1 percent of  the population. In contrast, in the United States, approximately half  of all households own shares in publicly traded stocks.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRussians&#8217; interest in investing has grown  slowly. Although the Russian stock market was established in 1992, for years it  remained the exclusive domain of professional brokers. One reason was the  underdeveloped market itself, but additionally, according to Strebkov, Russians  lacked &#8220;elementary financial literacy as an essential component of market  economic culture.&#8221; Potential investors did not trust financial instruments and the  possibility of making money on the stock market made no sense; they only  regarded securities as an alternative to bank deposits.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe mentality began to change in the  mid-2000s. The general population was becoming more prosperous and people  increasingly saw investing in stocks as a way to manage their personal savings.  Additionally, by that time, a sustainable growth in the capitalization of the  Russian stock markets had been achieved, and brokerages took off. A new kind of  Russian was emerging who did not depend entirely on state paternalism and had  self-management skills. &#8220;A  new bourgeois personality type emerged, gauging happiness, freedom and success  by the yardstick of money,&#8221; said Strebkov.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eInvestment instruments\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe investment instruments that are popular  today also appeared in the mid-2000s. Vladimir Solodukhi, managing director of  Brokkreditservis, a leading brokerage operating in Russia, described the market as  &#8220;overall, the standard Anglo-Saxon paradigm, maybe with some additional  regulations applied.&#8221; An ordinary Russian wishing to play the stock market  currently has two options &#8211; to invest in a collectively managed private mutual  fund (which requires just a few thousand rubles) or to open an individual  account with a stockbroker.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eIt is also possible to invest via private  trust management, which is an investment instrument like a mutual fund with a  personal touch &#8211; the right to decide which stocks to buy, a personal manager  and a team of analysts. Taking advantage of these services requires a few  million rubles.  &#8220;Investments in mutual funds are  recommended as long-term investments,&#8221; Solodukhin said. &#8220;This could be an  augmentation and, partially, an alternative to pension savings.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eIn contrast to developed markets, where  securities are acquired primarily to obtain dividends, the main objective of  Russian investors is to make money on the price difference. Many Russian public  companies often fail to pay dividends, and even when they do, the dividend rate  is insignificant. Prior to the 2008 economic crisis, unit  funds secured their investors incomes that were two to 10 times the inflation  and bank deposit rates. A yield of 30 percent was considered low, especially  for companies in the oil and gas, metals and banking sectors. The trend came to  a halt in 2008 and again in 2011; Russian private investors lost up to 50 percent  of their capital in unit funds.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAs a result, interest in the stock market  waned. The drop in stock prices worldwide combined with the high volatility of  the Russian market, which is caused by dependence on fluctuating raw material  prices, prompted investors to exercise caution or postpone active investment.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTrend towards independence\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eBut in the midst of crisis, a new group of  semi-professional investors with access to online trading emerged. Futures on  the RTS and MICEX indeces (the two merged in late 2011) became popular trading  instruments with these private investors, who played the stock market independently.  Short-term speculation using automated software enabled private players to  increase their original investments several times over. According to data from Investfunds.ru,  in the first half of 2011, net investments in unit funds were in excess of 5.8  billion rubles, which is triple the amount in the same period of 2010. In August 2011,  however, the indices fell and earnings generated in the first six months  depreciated.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eDespite the overall increase in the number  of private clients with brokerage accounts, their operations decreased in 2011,  according to figures from RTS. The number of private investors conducting more  than one transaction a month fell to 96,000 in 2011 from 104,000 in 2010. Finam  remained the market leader in terms of the number of clients, with 18,373,  followed by Brokkreditservis with 15,852 and Sberbank with 13,738.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlternative to banks\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAnalysts are certain that, for the private  investor, especially a relatively prosperous one, the stock market is a good  alternative to banks. Yet the Russian unit fund market is very small. Vladimir  Savvov, head of the analysis department at Otkrytie Bank, said: &#8220;The total net  asset value of all Russian unit funds is less than 500 billion rubles, which is  not much compared to the 10 trillion rubles in bank deposits.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe government&#8217;s strategy for promoting the  Russian stock market for the period up to 2020 envisages an increase in the  number of private investors to 20 million. The figure was dismissed by the  Audit Chamber, which cited the low activity of domestic long-term investors.  &#8220;If the situation proves favorable, with no new waves of recession, we might  reach 4-5 million, but by no means 20 million,&#8221; said Finam President Vladislav  Kochetkov.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

A price fluctuation in excess of 2 percent is considered sufficient to alarm traders on a developed market, but for Russia, 1 to 2 percent is routine. The Russian market is among the cheapest in the world, and investors used to emerging economies have long been taking advantage of the discounts. But more and more, investors from developed economies are discovering this open secret, with plenty of encouragement from the Russian government. Shares can be bought in U.S. dollars; investment companies issue regular marketing surveys in both Russian and English; and the main R.T.S. index has a comprehensive English-language version of its Web site. The Russian market is the most attractive of all the emerging economies in terms of its basic indices. &#8220;By the price-to-earnings [p/e] ratio and E.B.I.D.T.A., the Russian market is among the cheapest in the world,&#8221; said Oleg Achkasov, head of equity trading at V.T.B. Capital. &#8220;For example, the average p/e ratio in Russia is 5, compared with 8 to 10 in other emerging markets.&#8221; Achkasov explained the discount as the result of Russia&#8217;s problems with governance and transparency issues. However, he continued, once these are resolved, the discount is likely to disappear. Foreigners interested in trying their luck on the Russian stock market are first faced with the challenge of selecting a broker. While most foreign investors prefer to work with someone from their own country, local brokers say this is a mistake as the foreign banks operating in Russia do not make trading on the Russian market part of their core business.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003e&#8220;They [the foreign banks] have worked here long enough; some have been successful, but their main source of income lies outside Russia,&#8221; said Achkasov. &#8220;By contrast, for us it as our key product; Russian companies have a broader product lineup, better contacts and deeper market analysis.&#8221; Achkasov added that foreign investors should not be afraid of working with Russian brokerages as they keep up with foreign regulations and often have branches registered in Europe, the United States, China and other countries that operate in compliance with the local legislation. After determining with whom to invest, an investor must consider what to buy. &#8220;The Russian stock market (like any other) is a notion combining thousands of instruments and shares. The simplest and most reliable instrument is blue chips &#8211; the biggest companies, mostly oil, telecoms and financial corporations. They grow steadily but slowly, i.e., the risks are lowest here but the yield is far from the best,&#8221; said Alexander Parfyonov, an analyst at Unison Capital. &#8220;At the same time, the low-liquidity second and third tiers trade potentially high-yield securities of smaller companies that are not always transparent. Blue chips provided an average yield of 4 to 5 percent from January to September 2011, whereas in the third tier, yields averaged 20 percent.&#8221; Parfyonov suggests that Russia may become a more attractive option the longer the global financial crisis goes on. &#8220;Many of these securities will become a safe haven for their owners if the global economy slips into a new recession,&#8221; Parfyonov said. &#8220;Should the situation on the world financial market deteriorate and should the market value of stock fall, these stocks will safeguard their holders against excessive losses and yield considerable profits when the situation gets back to normal.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The stock analysis center Infin wrote in a recent analytical report entitled &#8220;Targeting the IT Market&#8221; that the market could very soon return to the volumes and growth rates witnessed before the crisis hit, as long as nominal GDP grows by 18.5 percent annually and the ruble continues to strengthen. Currently Russian IT companies control 1 percent of the global market for information technology product and services, worth roughly $16 to 20 billion. The Ministry of Economic Development forecasts that the volume of the Russian IT market will hit $32 million by 2013. But behind these positive numbers are questions about the sector&#8217;s overall potential. In 2011 the World Economic Forum rated Russia 77th in the world for growth in the information and communications technologies sector and 3rd among resource-oriented countries. Today Russia exports at most $1.5 billion of IT services, and no more than 300,000 people work in the country&#8217;s IT industry.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe future is in the clouds\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eHardware continues to dominate the Russian IT market, making up more than 50 percent of the sector. In contrast, hardware is only 30 percent of the European IT market. The rest of the segment there belongs to IT services (50 percent) and software (20 percent). &#8220;This is the heritage of the past,&#8221; said Konstantin Chernyshov, a chief analyst at Uralsib financial corporation, discussing the situation in Russia. &#8220;Many Russian companies started making or assembling hardware, but this share is shrinking gradually as more and more companies are switching to making software and other high marginal segments.&#8221; One place Russian companies hope to compete with international players is in cloud technology. Although this sector is fairly small at the moment, Chernyshov believes its growth rates will blow away similar figures across the entire IT services market in the period up to 2015. The Russian government is a major promoter of cloud technology. One project in the works is a national cloud service for organizing inter-departmental computerized interaction. It will also provide state and municipal services to the public. Market intelligence firm IDC predicts that the value of the cloud services market in Russia in 2015 will reach $1.2 billion. In 2010, the market was valued at just $35 million. Cloud technology is one of 15 priority areas supported by the Skolkovo Innovation Center, the government&#8217;s &#8220;Silicon Valley&#8221; rising outside of Moscow. Cloud technology is part of Skolkovo&#8217;s information technologies cluster along with multimedia search systems, video and audio processing and recognition, mobile applications, complex engineering solutions, green information technologies, wireless sensor networks and more.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe Skolkovo project is just one way the government has ramped up its support of the sector over the past two to three years. An increasing number of state agencies are now accessible online; various information projects have begun, and the state has stepped up its war against pirated property and commercial raids. Moreover, the government has talked of developing online media and the commercial operation of fourth-generation networks. State-sponsored industrial parks are emerging, and the government has introduced special economic zones that have reduced taxation and other benefits. But because the Russian government has suddenly become the biggest customer on the IT market, many companies are being created to serve governmental purposes, which has both positive and negative consequences. For one thing, it makes the sector much more sensitive to changes in the state budget. Growth in the IT sector lags three to four months behind that of other sectors, such as manufacturing, partially for this reason. Additionally, the state does not have the best track record in developing IT projects. For example, the federal target program Electronic Russia (2002&#8211;2012), which was deemed a failure and was replaced by the state program Information Society (2011&#8211;2018). Moreover, the state program for creating high-tech technology parks, which was supposed to use 10.3 billion rubles ($342 million) to create 10 development areas by 2010, was suspended mostly because of disappointing results. The program was later extended until 2014 and given an additional earmark of 13 billion rubles ($432 million). &#8220;Officials just need a tick in the documents while business is focused on the profit,&#8221; said Ilya Rachenkov, an analyst with InvestCafe. But government support is needed to make any positive developments in the system and even skeptics admit that its influence is not all bad. Rachenkov confirms that he has heard good opinions on Skolkovo from businesses of all sizes. &#8220;For them it&#8217;s a place where they can come and get real investment without long bureaucratic procedures. Everybody is surprised because start-ups are traditionally supported by investment angels, not government.&#8221; Nevertheless, both Rachenkov and Chernyshov believe the private sector would do a better job in developing the IT industry than the government. Even here, however, there are barriers to entry.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRussia&#8217;s IT market is dominated by several big companies. The top 10 Russian IT firms accounted for 70 percent of all revenue earned by Russia&#8217;s top 30 IT companies. These top 10 control 54 percent of the Russian IT market &#8211; 5 percent more than in 2009. Although Konstantin Chernyshov notes that none of the companies alone controls the lion&#8217;s share of the market and so there is still hope for IT start-ups, new companies struggle to receive funding. Additionally, they suffer from high taxes on labor, which come to roughly five to 10 percent of company expenses in non-commodities industries, cut into profits. For companies willing to pay the labor costs, there are other problems. Foreign competitors such as Apple, HP, Foxconn and TrendMicro are entering the Russian IT market in droves, and this expansion will only increase after Russia joins the World Trade Organization. These companies have notable financial resources and leading technologies to attract Russia&#8217;s top IT specialists. &#8220;Many foreign software companies already have Russian specialists on staff,&#8221; said Rachenkov, and this is likely to increase as these companies establish themselves on Russian territory. And despite the country&#8217;s reputation as a source of top software designers and engineers, the reality is that the pool of actually qualified specialists is limited. &#8220;Sometimes you have to wait for months to fill any given vacancy that requires knowledge that you would be hard-pressed to call specific,&#8221; said one company representative, who preferred to remain anonymous. Although Russoft saw a 17 percent gain in the export of software from Russia (up to 3.1 billion dollars) in 2010 over 2009, analysts believe imports will continue to form the majority of the Russian software market.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003e&#8220;Whether an IT start-up can become successful or not is a question of the right strategy and marketing,&#8221; said Konstantin Chernyshov. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean that any start-up will grow into a giant company in Russia, because the market is saturated and divided. But now it&#8217;s a land of opportunities.&#8221; Experts believe that the future of the IT market is in the Russian regions. The country&#8217;s IT sector is currently concentrated in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but more and more residents outside these major cities are coming online, and the number of Internet users in the regions is expected to explode in the next five to 10 years. Other potential growth segments include search engines and navigation software, according to Ilya Rachenkov. This is due to opportunities and challenges that make the Russian market unique. The complexity of the Russian language has allowed local companies like Yandex to dominate the market for search. Google is a distant second in the Russian search market. While the finally active Glonass &#8211; Russia&#8217;s answer to GPS &#8211; has stimulated development in navigation. But overall growth in the IT sector, like in the rest of Russia&#8217;s economy, will depend on real economic growth, an increase in investment activity, stabilization of the country&#8217;s financial and political situation, an increase in personal incomes, a stable exchange rate, moderate inflation and benefits that can encourage new enterprises to form.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eBy the end of this year, trains equipped with automatic track gauge changeover systems will be put into operation on routes between Russia and European capitals. This will allow the trains to continue into the European Union without having to readjust their gauge at the Russian border. A total of 10 international train routes originate in Russia, continuing on to Romania, Germany, Hungary, and France. Russian Railways (RZD) President Vladimir Yakunin announced this development to journalists in Brussels after the opening of the European Parliament&#8217;s first ever expo devoted to Russia&#8217;s railways. The new Talgo train transformers will be received by June of this year and will run on the Moscow-Kiev and Moscow-Berlin routes. As a result, the journey to Berlin, for example, will be reduced to nine hours. Russian railway personnel have also ordered seven 20-car trains with the automatic gauge changeovers at a cost of 135 million euros ($177.5 million). Under the terms of the contract, the trains must be delivered in 2014 and 2015. Russian railway workers have big plans for the restoration of railways in southern Europe in preparation for a possible southern transport corridor. &#8220;We are considering participation in modernizing infrastructure in some southern European countries,&#8221; Yakunin said. In March 2011 at a meeting between Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Serbian President Boris Tadic, the two discussed an $800 million loan, part of which would be used to improve rail infrastructure in Serbia. RZD subsidiaries could collaborate with Serbians in modernizing the railway station in Belgrade and two segments of the local railways using this line of credit.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe leaders of the European Parliament and other EU bodies have also expressed an interest in transcontinental projects that aim to create a land bridge for transporting goods from China to Europe via Russia. Here, however, there are some difficulties. &#8220;A regulatory framework has already been established for EU countries, but we live by different standards &#8211; not only the railways,&#8221; Yakunin said. &#8220;The question is of how to find a common understanding and how to invest money in this land bridge.&#8221; According to forecasts by international experts, key financial and trade flows in the will increasingly be concentrated in the U.S.-Europe-Asia-Pacific Region triangle. For railways, this means the ability to increase shipments from this region to Europe is extremely important. But for this to happen, Russia&#8217;s competitive position on the transport market must be strengthened by establishing the necessary technological, regulatory, legal, and tariff conditions. RZD hopes to reduce cargo transit time along this corridor through Russia by two days &#8211; that is, from 14 to 12 or maybe even 10 days, according to Yakunin&#8217;s estimates. Yakunin said RZD is also looking into international projects in other parts of the world. The company is considering participating in the electrification of the 28.5 mile Tabriz-Azarshahr line in Iran, and participation in the construction of the Rasht (Iran)-Astara line in Azerbaijan in cooperation with the Azerbaijani and Iranian railways. Yakunin said that EU sanctions against Iran would not affect the project. He explained, however, that he would not discuss &#8220;the correctness or incorrectness of the sanctions,&#8221; since that&#8217;s at &#8220;a political level.&#8221; &#8220;But as for the development of cooperation, I have always maintained that sanctions are unable to resolve accumulated political and inter-civilizational problems, which can only be resolved through cooperation,&#8221; Yakunin said, giving his personal opinion.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The AR Films fund will enable the partners to make six more $20-million films in 2012-2014, said Kosinski. Rodnyansky describes these films as &#8220;intelligent, character-driven films.&#8221; Without giving names, Rodnyansky promises that the films will feature leading world stars. Most contributors to the fund are private investors from Eastern Europe, Asia and the United States; there are none from Russia. The fund&#8217;s managers promise at least a 10-15 percent return on an investment. The fund will follow the model common in the U.S. film industry: the creative team &#8211; from director to actors &#8211; will not receive any royalties until all settlements have been made with investors. If the film does well at the box office, investors may look forward to a 20 percent bonus. In 2002, Alexander Rodnyansky became the General Director of the STS TV channel and, subsequently, the entire STS Media holding structure. He left the company in 2009 to set up AR Films. He acquired a controlling stake in the company Non-Stop Production; the distributor Cinema Without Frontiers; the German A Company, which distributes TV and film content in Eastern Europe; and became the sole owner of Sochi&#8217;s Kinotavr Film Festival.  The figure of $20 million per film is calculated to allow for a profit. Andrei Smirnov, President of Sistema Mass Media, notes that a budget of $20 million will enable a film to recoup its costs through international sales for distribution, TV and DVD.

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003e&#8220;Comfortable office space in the center of Moscow, nifty silver  MacBooks and shiny iPads, $150,000 for your prototype but, most importantly, advice  from leading IT entrepreneurs and investors.&#8221; This is how the Farminers venture  fund encourages new entrepreneurs to take part in its start-up academy. Founded  by Igor Matsanyuk, a veteran of the Russian gaming market and Alena  Vladimirskaya, Director of the Pruffi recruiting agency, Farminers offers  candidates free offices, office appliances and $150,000 for equipment and  salaries. In return, start-ups are supposed to supply Farminers with  interesting projects, specifically online services for the mass market that can  be finalized within three to six months. In November 2011, the first 15  projects were selected out of 1,500 applications, and the plan is to launch  them within six months. Farminers General Director Maxim Matveyko expects the  academy to process some 35-36 projects annually. The lucky candidates will be  able to work on their projects under daily guidance from project managers and  Farminers experts. In return for its support, the fund will acquire a 40  percent stake in each project fostered. The academy aims to sell all portfolio  projects to other investors within six months.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eSo far, there has been relatively little investment in Russian companies  during early venture capital financing stages. According to the Russian Venture  Capital Association, such investments amounted to $151 million in 2010, or 6 percent  of total direct investments. Of this amount, a mere $19.5 million was invested  in companies at the seed and startup stages &#8211; this spread out among 29  companies. But since the second half of 2010, small venture funds similar to  Farminers have started to emerge in the market, positioning themselves as  business incubators, accelerators or project factories. Some examples include  Fast Lane Ventures, Glavstart, Bricolage, Techdrive, and Yandex.Factory. They  all look for promising startups in order to teach them business practices and  raise them towards investment maturity. Unlike in more mature markets, however,  these venture funds have also had to incorporate training into their support,  since many Russian innovation companies have little to offer besides their  ideas.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003e&#8220;There are almost no Russian companies at later development  phases that are suitable for investing, so we have to raise what we have,&#8221; said  Dmitry Repin, General Director of Digital October innovation technologies center.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eArkady Moreinis, founder of the Glavstart fund agrees: &#8220;The  ideas our authors bring to us and the projects they ultimately work on are  absolutely different,&#8221; Moreinis said.  Each  of the 13 companies his fund has taken on has received $100,000 from Glavstart in  return for a 40 percent stake.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eFast Lane Ventures is a slightly different kind of fund. It  generates projects itself and then invites startups to join in. The online  footwear shop Sapato.ru is believed to be its most successful project.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThis winter, TexDrive will launch biannual three-month accelerated  development programs, during which about 70 Russian and 30 foreign mentors will  give marketing, management and economics advice to young innovators. &#8220;During  this period, these companies will be able to complete what would otherwise take  them 9 to 12 months,&#8221; said TexDrive partner Andrei Kessel. In November 2011,  the accelerator fund chose 10 startups out of several hundred applications. Each  of the 10 participants in the acceleration program will receive $25,000 right away  and another $125,000 during the final phase of the project, in exchange for a  10 percent stake. After that, TexDrive promises the chosen ones $1 million from  American angel investors.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe funds make it clear that this symbiosis of a mentoring  investor and a startup means that entrepreneurs should be ready to share their  intellectual property rights. For example, Farminers will register intellectual  property to a third company in which the fund will own 40 percent and the start-up  the remaining 60 percent.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eNearly all private venture funds confine themselves to a narrow  range of trendy industries: the Internet, software, mobile and cloud services.  It is simpler to review such projects and they offer quick results. This  predisposition, however, means that companies working in other economic  segments &#8211; medicine and pharmaceuticals, for example &#8211; must rely on state  financing. These start-ups can receive venture financing from four sources:  Russian Venture Company&#8217;s seed investments fund, the Fund for the Promotion of  Small Business in the Scientific and Technical Sphere (Bortnik Fund), the Fund  for the Promotion of Venture Investments in Small Scientific and Technical  Companies in Moscow and, finally, the Skolkovo Fund.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eBut these funds do have money to go around. In 2011, the  Skolkovo Fund gave 5.8 billion rubles&#8217; ($185 million) worth of grants to 70  innovation companies, which is a record high for a single venture fund in the  history of venture investments in Russia. Yet, to get the coveted grants, candidates  need to go through the tedious process of getting on the list of Skolkovo  residents.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003ePavel Nikonov, senior manager with ABRT fund, said that startups  will have the best chance if they apply for grants to the Bortnik Fund&#8217;s annual  investment program, called Start. It includes a three-year 6 million-ruble ($190,000)  grant and a high, 20 percent, acceptance rate compared to only 1 percent of  candidates approved by private venture funds. In 2010, 107 projects received  financing out of 515 applications.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eIt is even easier to receive free money in Moscow. Executive  Director of the Fund for the Promotion of Venture Investments Alexei Kostrov  told SF that, in 2011, his organisation provided 270 million roubles in  subsidies to more than 50 innovation companies and the approval ratio reached  90%. The fund also paid for 100 fellowship programmes at Cambridge.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eIn short, a startuper can find a place to dwell, receive money  and learn the ropes. There are not many places like this yet but their numbers  are growing by the year.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Instead of providing a single NSP distribution, the developer &#8211; PingWin software &#8211; is suggesting four, one from each major Russian Linux developer.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRussian officials hope that, in due course, the National Software Platform will help save the money currently spent on software licences. They are planning to cut spending by 80 percent or 1.72 trillion rubles ($55.3 billion) within a few years, according to the project presentation.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe NSP first appeared in the news in the summer of 2010. Russian officials decided not to reinvent the operating system but, rather borrow a distribution of Linux, a free operating system with open source codes. Under the 2010 state program for promoting an information society from 2011 through 2020, in the first two years, NSP development would require 490 million rubles. Within 12 months of the program\u0027s launch, NSP is supposed to account for 2 percent of all OS installations on Russian computers &#8211; mostly through a roll-out to organizations funded by the state budget, although governmental bodies at both the federal and regional level are not included. In two years, the figure is expected to rise to 5 percent.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003ePingWin software was awarded the contract to develop the NSP in September 2011 through a competitive tender. The company is a branch of the NGI fund, which is partially owned by former Telecommunications Minister Leonid Reiman. Ironically, even though it took part in the tender, PingWin supported the protest of the Russian Partnership for Promotion of Free Software Development (RASPO) against the tender and even against the very idea of creating a single NSP distribution. PingWin General Director Dmitry Komissarov promised to engage programmers working for RASPO member companies in developing the national platform.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003ePingWin was ready with the prototype documentation in late October, but it took the state almost two months to approve it.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eA prototype is a &#8220;complex thing,&#8221; said Vitaly Lipatov, an expert on the inspection board and General Director of the St. Petersburg-based Linux developer Etersoft. It is a large project with 73 test phases, each of them more than just &#8220;pushing a button.&#8221; Tests were run for five days, including three days at the ministry and two days via remote access. According to Telecommunication Minister Igor Schegolve, the project was examined and sent back for revision more than once, but finally at the end of December, the commission announced that PingWin had corrected all the major faults.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eCreation of the NSP prototype has resulted in development of the terms of reference for creating the platform itself. According to Komissarov, PingWin suggested having four release packages instead of one, to be based on the four major Russian distributions &#8211; Alt Linux, MSVSfera, Naulinux and Rosa. PingWin demonstrated that these distributions would be mutually compatible.  A pool of algorithms and software compatible with all distributions will be formed and there will be a single operator managing this pool.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eDeputy Telecoms Minister Ilya Massukh said that it would be possible to develop NSP software not only based on the Linux OS: ministries, agencies and other organizations financed by the government will be able to lease software via Internet cloud services.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eFirst published in Russian at vedomosti.ru.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe Russian government has been making subtle efforts to persuade   foreign automakers to invest in the country\u0027s booming auto industry,   even as it plans to slam the door on the industry\u0027s tax incentive regime   later this year. In an unexpected move, the Ministry of Economic   Development said it has decided to extend the limitation period for   foreign automakers that have signed on to the country\u0027s   industry-assembly regime but could not take full advantage of the tax   incentive because of the global financial crisis. The move, which   analysts say could give fresh momentum to the heady growth of the   country&#8217;s auto industry, will afford foreign automakers with dormant   agreements enough time to decide whether or not to build car plants in   the country. The industry-assembly regime, which was first introduced in 2005, had   allowed carmakers to import components with zero or three percent   duties in return for investment agreements to make at least 300,000 cars   locally a year. Some foreign carmakers have taken advantage of the tax   incentive to close deals in Russia, where passenger-car sales may reach   three million by 2014 to surpass Germany as Europe&#8217;s biggest auto   market. A revised plan, presented in February 2010, allowed automakers   to pursue the so-called semi-knocked down production during the first   three years, in addition to receiving tax benefits for eight-year   investment agreements. After that carmakers should start to produce   engines locally, and by the eighth year local components should make up   60 percent of the vehicles. Foreign automakers have so far   signed a total of 31 agreements, 23 of which are currently being   utilized in many assembly plants producing various models of Renault,   Nissan, Toyota, Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen, Peugeot and Citroen, Dmitry   Levchenko, the head of special economic zones and project finance   department at the Economic Development Ministry, told journalists on   Monday. Levchenko said the government still plans to terminate all   previously signed but inactivated agreements on the industry-assembly   regime by the end of this year, a move analysts say was designed to jolt   automakers into action. Levchenko warned that while the government does   not intend to invalidate any of the existing agreements, the Economic   Development Ministry would not be able to revise or update them next   year, which could in effect render those agreements useless. Levchenko   said some of the foreign automakers, including Japanese carmaker   Mitsubishi Motors, which owns 30 percent of the PSA Peugeot Citroen\u0027s   PSMA Rus factory in Kaluga, are holding on to &#8220;dormant agreements,&#8221; even   though some already operate car assemblies in Russia. Three other   foreign automakers &#8211; Japanese carmaker Suzuki, Canadian auto parts maker   Magna and the Ukrainian automobile corporation (UkrAvto) &#8211; also have   dormant agreements that could still be reactivated under the   industry-assembly regime, he said. However, none of those mentioned by   Levchenko appeared prepared to take the government up on its latest   offer, Russian newspaper Vedomosti reported on Tuesday. Japanese   Suzuki Motor Corporation signed the industry-assembly agreement in   2007, followed by an announcement that it would spend $115 million to   open its first Russian plant at a St. Petersburg site in 2009. The   plant, which was expected to employ 500 people, was slated to start   production in late 2009 and churn out 30,000 cars per year including the   Grand Vitara, a sports utility vehicle and Suzuki\u0027s bestseller in   Russia, and the SX4, a crossover. However, the carmaker abandoned the   plan during the 2009 financial crisis and returned a 23-hectare plot it   bought for the purpose. Analysts have said that Suzuki Motor, which saw a   24-percent upswing in sales in Russia last year, could indeed afford to   build a plant with a production capacity of 30,000 vehicles per year in   Russia. &#8220;The only snag being that Suzuki may find it difficult to   comply with the industrial assembly agreement, which entails a reduction   of component imports by 30 percent over several years,&#8221; said Ivan   Bonchev, an auto analyst with Ernst & Young. The United   Transport Technologies (UTT), a subsidiary of UkrAvto, had also planned   to invest an estimated at $770 million to open a 240,000-capacity car   plant in the Nizhny Novgorod Region in 2008. The plan, which was later   shelved, was to assemble Chevrolet Lanos, commercial vehicles and Isuzu   trucks at the plant by 2012. It has not been an easy ride for the   Canadian Magna, too. While the auto parts manufacturer signed a   memorandum of understanding last year that gave it the right to conclude   an agreement on new industry-assembly regime, it has stopped short of   signing an agreement. Analysts say a lack of a proprietary brand might   have made it difficult for the Canadian company to find willing partners   in Russia. \"In addition, the Russian government has to lower tariffs on   imported cars after the country\u0027s accession to the World Trade   Organization, and this will inevitably reduce incentives to build new   car plants in Russia,\" Bonchev said. \"Foreign automakers will simply   find it easier to import cars from their existing plants elsewhere.\"\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eBribing  foreign public officials may become a criminal offense in Russia if the   State  Duma passes a law committing the country to the Convention on Combating   Bribery  of Foreign Public Officials of the Organization for Economic Cooperation   and Development. If the convention is adopted, bribing officials abroad   will be  subject to criminal prosecution in Russia. Adoption of the bribery   convention is a major  condition for acceding to the OECD. Russia, which has been attempting  to join the organization for a long time, has yet to bring itself in   line with  all the OECD&#8217;s standards. Experts  warn that if the convention is adopted, certain countries and even entire  continents will be off limits to Russian business. &#8220;Naturally, one has to  follow the rules existing in each specific country. In Africa,  for example, corruption goes beyond all conceivable limits and, unfortunately,  it is impossible to conduct business there without greasing somebody&#8217;s palm.  The situation there is much worse than in Russia. Naturally, if Russian  businessmen do not offer bribes, they will not have any business there. In  Europe and America, there is  no corruption, so let&#8217;s do something about Africa,  or leave the continent altogether,&#8221; said Vladimir Skripnichenko, CEO of the  Center for Study and Assessment of Legal and Economic Problems of Business. According  to a recent study by Transparency International, Russian entrepreneurs are  among the world&#8217;s greatest bribe-givers, second only to the Chinese.  &#8220;Representatives from Russian companies are the most likely to offer bribes  abroad, both to public officials and employees of private companies,&#8221; said Ivan  Ninenko, Transparency International&#8217;s deputy director in Russia. &#8220;Our  companies simply do not regard giving bribes as something out of the ordinary. It  is common practice for them, and in Russia, it is often inevitable. Furthermore,  this is caused by the absence of punishment, unlike in other countries, where  anti-corruption laws have long since been adopted and many companies caught  giving bribes abroad, including in Russia, have had to face serious  financial and reputation losses as a consequence.&#8221;  In  keeping with the international anti-corruption convention, Western governments  have repeatedly had to punish their businesses for bribing Russian  officials. In September 2004, French authorities suspected the oil company  Total of giving bribes in Russia  and Iraq  to obtain contracts. The company was reported to have spent $20 million on  bribing officials in these countries between 1996 and 2001. The investigation  was continued only with regard to Iraq, however.  On Nov. 15, 2006, the German prosecutor&#8217;s office accused the  telecommunications division of Siemens of paying 77 bribes totaling &#8364;12 million  ($15 million) to officials in Nigeria,  Libya and Russia. In Russia alone,  38 high-level officials from dozens of regional state companies received &#8364;2  million ($2.5 million) from Siemens. The German industrial giant was fined more  than &#8364;200 million ($253 million) as a result.  In March 2010, the U.S.  authorities accused the German car manufacturer Daimler of bribing officials in  22 countries, including Russia.  Daimler&#8217;s Russian clients included the Ministry of the Interior, the Defenze  Ministry, the Special-Purpose Garage of the Federal Protective Service, and the  government of Moscow.  The company, which had dished out $5 million to bribe-takers to obtain  contracts, had to pay a $185 million fine to put a stop to the judicial  inquiry.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirst published in Kommersant FM. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAs Alexander Kravtsov, the man behind the Expeditsiya brand, was traveling around Chile, he came across a figurine of a man at a souvenir shop. When you pulled a string, his tiny penis went up. Kravtsov bought the toy and sent it to a factory in Indonesia, asking them to make the same figurines in the image of the Russian Santa Claus, Ded Moroz. This story is typical of Kravtsov&#8217;s approach to his business, which balances sales between serious equipment for outdoor activities and novelty products. So far, the Expeditsiya chain&#8217;s combination of highly efficient logistics and an original and eye-catching assortment of goods has proved to be extremely successful. Today there are around 360 Expeditsiya stores across Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Every year the company also organizes the Expeditsiya Trophy off-road race, one of the longest winter car races in the world. The company&#8217;s annual revenue is close to $100 million, with a profit margin of around 20 percent. Most of the products are made in Southeast Asia, but Kravtsov also owns a factory outside Moscow where some of the goods are assembled. The Expeditsiya story started in 2005, when Kravtsov quit his job in the household chemical industry and drew upon his training as a geologist. When geologists are looking for minerals, different geological maps of the same area are placed on top of each other, and drilling begins where the contours meet. Kravtsov decided to build his business where the outdoor tourism and souvenir industries overlapped. And this position in the market is perhaps the secret of Kravtsov&#8217;s success &#8211; the brand has virtually no competitors. Expeditsiya occupies the middle ground between the outdoor sports retail sector and the gift and souvenir sector, and the main players in both of these markets do not see Kravtsov as one of them. &#8220;Kravtsov&#8217;s company is geared towards a more light-hearted breed of outdoor tourism,&#8221; said Dmitry Sazhin, marketing director of AlpIndustria. &#8220;The team at Expeditsiya have been very shrewd and have managed to develop a new niche,&#8221; agreed Alexander Osadchy, General Manager of gift chain LeFutur. All goods and services that come under the Expedition brand are generally divided into three sections: &#8220;before and after the trip,&#8221; &#8220;on the trip&#8221; and &#8220;fun.&#8221; Kravtsov associates the first category with a certain nostalgia for travel in and around Russia. For the trip itself, Expedition sells outdoor activity equipment that can also be used in everyday life such as camping mugs, utensils and flashlights . The &#8220;fun&#8221; part of the business means the famous orange T-shirts with humorous captions on the back, Expetro! toys, a kit for sex &#8220;in extreme conditions&#8221; and various other knick-knacks for which the brand has become known. A customer once told Kravstov that he had bumped into a couple of strangers in the middle of nowhere in Russia&#8217;s Far North, and they, like him, were both were wearing the orange Expeditsiya T-shirts.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAccording to Kravtsov, the tourism component of the brand is built on &#8220;genuine life experiences,&#8221; and Kravtsov will be the first to admit that the souvenir and novelties section of his business is not the result of his own ideas. In fact, Kravtsov has introduced a ban on innovation. &#8220;We prefer to keep an eye on what&#8217;s out there, take what we find into our business, and not waste time and energy on thinking up new products,&#8221; he said. For example, Kravtsov and his managers once went to a Hong Kong restaurant where one of the rooms was made of ice; Kravtsov now plans to install a similar room in one of his three Expeditsiya restaurants. On a trip to the United States, the businessman bought a map of the world, where the owner can mark the countries he has visited by rubbing out the background; today he has a similar item as part of his own product range. Kravtsov says that around 80 percent of Expedition products are result of industrial espionage. Absurd as it may seem, the chain does not spend a single kopek on advertising. The ubiquitous orange T-shirts have been enough to make the brand known. And the Expeditsiya Trophy also attracts a lot of media attention. Kravtsov says the success of his company also relies on a constant renewal of the range of goods on offer, with new products forming between 35-40 percent of the company&#8217;s revenues. That said, Expeditsiya&#8217;s most popular products continue to sell well for up to five years. Competitors from related sectors say that the well-selected range of goods on offer in Expeditsiya stores is one of the keys to the company&#8217;s success. &#8220;If they continue to uphold their clearly defined image, Expeditsiya stands to grow and prosper in years to come,&#8221; said Sazhin from AlpIndustryia. But LeFutur&#8217;s Osadchy believes that no matter how good the idea, times move on, and if Expeditsiya wants to continue to expand its business and increase its profits, it may have to start concentrating on other commercial ideas. According to Kravtsov, at the moment the company is planning to expand in terms of geography rather than concept. Expeditsiya is now setting its sights on foreign markets. In November 2011, Expeditsiya products started to appear in stores in Singapore and Holland. And what about new directions and new ideas? &#8220;We are in a position where we could take a roll of toilet paper, put a whistle in there, label it as a special camping kit, and slap on a price tag of 500 rubles ($16),&#8221; said Kravtsov. &#8220;We&#8217;d have no problem selling it.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eA resourceful immigrant to Canada, he now works as a manager at a   landfill. In his spare time, Pavel bulldozes gravel and chops down trees   on his multihectare property in Langley, a Vancouver suburb. Even with   his biceps covered and the chainsaw turned off, &#8220;Pasha,&#8221; as his   customers call him, does not create the impression of being a pushover. What keeps drawing the much less burly Vancouverites to visit Pasha is the Russian banya he has built in his yard. Among ex-Soviet immigrants in North America, Dukhin is a member of   the fortunate minority who own their own banya, while others can only   pine for steam and curse common shower stalls for their inadequacy. But   things are looking up. As more and more emigre entrepreneurs open   commercial banyas across the continent, Russians and locals alike are   lining up to revel in the ancient tradition. Dukhin did his military service on a top-secret missile test range in   Kazakhstan and later became a tenacious businessman in the Moscow   region, plowing his way through post-Soviet crime and corruption. When   he first came to Vancouver eight years ago, a Russian friend invited him   to go to a sauna on the top floor of a high-rise apartment. &#8220;There were probably other Russians living in this building because   someone had ripped out the thermostat,&#8221; Dukhin said. &#8220;Usually you&#8217;re not   supposed to have temperatures of more than 80 degrees [Celsius]. We   went to 100.&#8221; The banya tradition dates back to the 11th century in Russia. A small   room &#8212; traditionally a wooden log shed, but brick structures and even   modified closets will do in a pinch &#8212; is heated by an electric or   wood-burning stove to well over 80 degrees. Copious amounts of water   poured on the heat source bring the humidity up to about the same level.   A visit to a banya begins with several rotations in and out of the   steamy room to allow the body to warm up. This cycle culminates with   banya aficionados beating each other with bunches of birch or pine   branches, called veniki, as a form of massage. Depending on the bravado   of the participant, the event could wrap up with a plunge in cold water   or a roll in the snow. This ritual is meant to stimulate sweating, cleanse skin, heal   wounds, relax muscles, relieve stress, promote metabolism and improve   one&#8217;s mood. Dukhin decided to build his own banya when he moved to a large land   plot in 2007. His budget was tight, but he managed to get some free   deals online. His friends also helped out for the noble cause. They   carted in furniture and one friend even supplied the flooring. A half-year after moving to the property, Dukhin was steaming in his   own banya. He started inviting friends over as soon as he had the roof   up. Gradually the banya turned into a side business. A visit is priced   at $150 for three hours regardless of how many people participate. The   price includes a veniki beating for two, and you get to take the bunched   branches home with you as a souvenir. This banya in Langley is one of the many commercial banyas that are now open in Canada and the United States. The Russian bathhouse on Gravesend Neck Road was built in 1979 and is   the oldest in Brooklyn, New York. On average, about 250 guests stew   there for three to four hours on the weekends. During the week, there   are banya sessions for young people. Students can be seen doing   schoolwork in between stints in the heat. &#8220;The idea was right,&#8221; said owner Israel Odessky, of his decision to   open a communal banya. &#8220;A Russian person loves the banya. &#8230; It means   relaxation. It is something for the soul.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Tradition Goes South\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAnatoly Goldshmid went to banyas in Ukraine since he was 3 years old,   and continued the routine even after he immigrated to the United   States.  Each Saturday for 25 years he drove for several hours to get to   one of the New York City banyas to keep his date with a twig bouquet. The move to Dallas left Goldshmid feeling unsettled. There were no banyas around. Working with urgency, Goldshmid set out to build his own banya and   within weeks had a reasonable facsimile operating in his house. Five   years ago, Goldshmid put up a banya complex in a Dallas suburb, which   remains the only communal Russian banya in the American Southwest. The banya business is also spreading in other directions. Alexander   Orlov, a Kiev native who now lives in New Jersey, sells veniki across   the East Coast as well as to Texas and Canada. He has built a cedar   banya in his house and takes orders to build banyas for expatriates from   the former Soviet Union who have settled in North America.  &#8220;I can&#8217;t live without a banya,&#8221; Orlov said.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Melting Pot of Clients\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eDukhin sent letters to two Vancouver Russian-language papers when he   opened up his banya to outside visitors. One of the papers replied with   just one word: &#8220;cool.&#8221; Then it published the ads. But the advertisements didn&#8217;t bring in as many people as Dukhin   expected. The most effective strategy for him has been word-of-mouth. Most commercial banyas still rely on this tactic. &#8220;It is very hard to write on paper what is a Russian banya,&#8221; said   Goldshmid, who advertised his Dallas-area banya on the Internet and in   local papers. It can also be hard to prove what the Russian banya is not. James   Schoenfeld, a regular customer at the Russian & Turkish Baths in   downtown New York City said that a &#8216;bathhouse&#8217; can easily be linked to   illicit behavior. &#8220;If they say &#8216;we&#8217;re going to a bathhouse,&#8217; someone will raise an   eyebrow,&#8221; Schoenfeld said, adding that word-of-mouth exchanges can   prevent such misunderstandings. Schoenfeld went to his first banya with a friend and enthusiastically   dived into all steps of the process, including a 30-minute oak-leaf   venik lashing. Shortly after jumping out of the ice pool, Schoenfeld   went to the banya&#8217;s front counter and bought a card for 15 more visits.   He now goes to the Manhattan banya twice a year and has even convinced   his girlfriend to join him. &#8220;It was a nice test,&#8221; Schoenfeld said. &#8220;Any girl who is willing to try this has to be pretty cool.&#8221; Westerners with a thirst for exploring other cultures are displacing   the Russians as the top customers in many banyas. In fact, 90 percent of   the clientele at the Wall Street Bath in the financial district of   Manhattan is not natively Russian. Its selling points include two steam   rooms, Russian-language posters and a restaurant that sells borsch and   solyanka. &#8220;We taught the Americans how to steam,&#8221; manager Dmitry Lerner said. &#8220;They steam now better than the Russians.&#8221; Legions of hockey fans flooded Odessky&#8217;s bathhouse in Brooklyn in   2000 when Sergei Nemchinov brought the Stanley Cup trophy in for a day. Odessky has a photo of himself kissing the cup and is only too happy   to give a guided tour of the signed hockey jerseys that hang on the   walls: Kovalyov, Morozov, Ovechkin, Semin, Fyodorov and other   high-profile athletes who had come in to be warmed and lashed. Even in his small banya, Dukhin maintains a steady stream of customers. To increase authenticity, Dukhin undergoes a costume change before he   serves his clients. He puts on a Soviet-style hat with a star on the   front and claps two flower-embroidered kitchen mittens together to   hustle his client, Igor Zemtsov, into the heated room. Dukhin follows   him in with a wooden bucket of hot water in which two veniki soak in   preparation. A few minutes later the only sound that can be heard is the whipping of the twigs as they hit Zemtsov&#8217;s body. &#8220;The most important thing is that you don&#8217;t get cold,&#8221; Dukhin teases as the beating intensifies. Zemtsov emerges from the room with steam rising from his body and a   relieved smile on his face. He embraces Dukhin as they say goodbye and   thanks him for ridding his body of its aches. &#8220;Tomorrow he&#8217;ll tell me that he is thinking about me,&#8221; Dukhin   chuckles as he watches Zemtsov drive away. He is sure this won&#8217;t be   Zemtsov&#8217;s last visit.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRussian financial analysts believe that 2012 is shaping up  to be even more difficult than the year that just ended. Economic problems  persist in Europe and the United States, and even China is starting to show  signs of a slowdown. And even if rumors of another global recession are  premature, analysts say that the Russian economy is unlikely to maintain its  growth. According to Troika Dialog strategist Chris Weafer, like 2011,  2012 will get off to a rough start, but improve in the second half of the year.  Vladimir Tikhomirov of Otrikitie Financial Corporation agrees. He has suggested  that the first months of this year will be impacted by Europe&#8217;s ongoing  struggle to find a way out of its debt crisis, which will impact both investor  sentiment and oil prices.  Tikhomirov predicted that in the first half of 2012, the price of oil will drop  below $100 a barrel. Yulia Tseplyaeva of BNP Paribas further predicted  that in the first quarter of 2012, the euro will reach a new low against the  dollar and along with it, the ruble exchange rate. Against this background and  in view of the presidential elections, in the first quarter, the exchange rate  may drop to 32-33 rubles per $1 according to Ivan Chakar of Renaissance  Capital. But then the  situation will begin to improve. Analysts are betting that European politicians  will be able to find a way out of the crisis and that the eurozone will not  fall apart. Weafer also believes that China will also cease to be a cause for  concern; it will be able to gently ground its economy to preserve stability  ahead of an expected change in leadership this fall. Tikhomirov believes that Russia&#8217;s economy will stabilize  after the March presidential elections and Tseplayeva agrees: &#8220;With the end of  political instability, repatriation of capital will begin, which, coupled with  rising oil prices &#8211; up to $120/barrel by the end of the year &#8211; will strengthen  the ruble to 28.55 per $1,&#8221; she said.  But others are not so optimistic. Alexei Moiseev of VTB  Capital believes that early in the year, the European Central Bank will start  large-scale quantitative easing, and if this is not successful, then another  round of quantitative easing will be led by the U.S. The resulting monetary  deluge would help the ruble: &#8220;We expect a strengthening of up to 28-29 rubles  per $1 in the first half of the year, then a seasonal rollback,&#8221; Moiseev said. However, Yevgeny Gavrilenkov of Troika Dialog warned that in  2012, Russian companies and banks have to pay about $75 billion in external  debtless than in 2011, but comparable to the expected current account  surplus. If global problems persist and debt refinancing continues to be  difficult, then the ruble will weaken as foreign currency earnings go to debt  servicing. So according to him, a rate of 33-34 rubles per $1 by the end of the  year should not come a surprise.  What everyone is sure of is that the exchange rate will  fluctuate more much strongly. &#8220;The ruble will fall and rise&#8211;&#8211;and many times,&#8221;  said Ksenia Yudaeva of Sberbank. It may be impossible for analysts  to agree on a forecast for the ruble, but there is a consensus on GDP growth.  Most analysts approve of the expectations of the Ministry of Economic  Development, which has forecast that economic growth will slow to 3.7 percent.  The Russian economy has lost its pre-crisis growth drivers and the factors that  drove growth in 2011 - post-crisis recovery of production sector stocks, rapid  credit growth, and a powerful increase in agricultural ouput &#8211; are unlikely to  work in 2012. Unemployment has almost reached  pre-crisis levels, as has capacity utilization. In December, companies reported  an increase in excess overhang compared to capacity demand and an intention to  cut personnel in 2012. The stagnation in demand while excess capacity grows  also indicates that investment activity in the industry is unlikely to  increase. In 2011, about 60 percent of GDP  growth was financed by bank loans - the same as it was at the height of economic  overheating in 2007, while on the average the 10-year credit resources ensured  approximately 30 percent growth, said Natalia Orlova of Alfa-Bank. This heavy  credit leverage weight should decline, which will slow the pace of GDP growth  to 2.6 percent, she said.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eOn New Year&#8217;s Day, the Single Economic Space (SES) between Kazakhstan, Russia and Belarus formally came into effect. The SES is expected to facilitate the free movement of goods, labor and capital within member-states, according to proponents of the project. There will be new deal for foreign investors too, as three member-states of the SES boast a combined population of 170 million and account for over 80 percent of the former Soviet Union&#8217;s economic potential. Their combined gross domestic product is estimated at $2 trillion, while the value of interstate commerce has gone up to $900 billion in recent years, making the economic space a formidable regional economic organization. The presidents of Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan put a final seal on the integration project during a December 9 meeting. The SES builds on a new single Customs Code, which has been in force for Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia since July 6, 2010. But the SES is also expected to be a precursor of a grander, supranational Eurasian Economic Commission modeled on the European Commission, which could start its work in 2015. Proponents of tighter integration have claimed that the Customs Union, which kicked off in January 2010, was a huge success. Transports and customs control has already moved from national borders to the Customs Union borders. According to official reports, Kazakhstan&#8217;s export to Russia increased by 38 percent and its export to Belarus more than doubled. Russia&#8217;s exports to Kazakhstan spiraled up 25 percent and foreign trade turnover between Belarus and Russia increased by 50 percent at the end of 2010. Such successes have prompted Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to tout the SES as Russia\u0027s way of \"reaching out with a hand of cooperation to our closest neighbors, to our friends, thereby creating conditions for economic modernization and improvement in people&#8217;s lives.&#8221; \"We have been working in the Customs Union for two years [and] the benefits are obvious,&#8221; Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev told a meeting of the Eurasian Economic Council and EurAsEC Interstate Council in late December. &#8220;There has been significant growth in bilateral trade: with Russia, we are approaching $20 billion, the current increase is 40 percent, and trade with Belarus is also increasing.\" Buoyed by such success, president Nazarbayev said the Customs Union could gain \"prominent positions in the global energy and grain markets, with the three countries together holding 90 billion barrels of oil reserves and accounting for 17 percent of global wheat exports.&#8221; This is no mean achievement for the Kremlin-led Customs Union, economists say. But those expecting immediate and dramatic transformation in the economies of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia over the next year are in for a long wait. Because of uneven economic development in the member states, the transition period in some areas extended to the 2017 to 2020 period. \"The real economic effect will be felt only after three or four years,\" said Natalya Orlova, the chief economist at Alfa Bank. \"From a consumer perspective, the creation of the SES offers many benefits, but in terms of employment there are drawbacks because non-competitive companies in member-states will eventually be forced to leave the market.\" Even though the creation of SES will greatly simplify trade procedures, reduce tariffs and remove barriers between countries, there are also negative implications for member countries, especially Russia, where the investment climate has been worsening, said Alexei Devyatov, the chief economist at UralSib Capital. \"Some businesses are likely to move to the neighboring states, like Kazakhstan, where the investment climate is more favorable,\" Devyatov said. \"But we are not likely to witness an exodus.\" The SES member states will also need to resolve systemic issues such as tax risks of doing business and foreign exchange interactions in member-state banks, said Konstantin Grechukhin, an analyst with a Russian audit firm MEF-Audit. \"In a common economic space, sharing knowledge and new technologies is the only way to go,\" Grechukhin said. And while Russia and Kazakhstan may have benefited from establishing the Customs Union, this is not necessarily true of the other members. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been alternating between showering praise on the integration project and heaping complaints on its implementation. During a recent press conference for Russian journalists, he blamed the global economic crisis, high Russian energy prices and the Customs Union for the severe currency crisis in Belarus. In particular, Lukashenko recalled the prohibitive duties imposed on imported cars last summer, which benefited the Russian car industry but prompted Belarusians to rush to buy used cars imported from the EU early in the year.  As a result, he said, Belarus lost $3 billion. The conditions under which Customs Union members operate have been unequal, Lukashenko said. Other economists, including New Economic School researcher Natalya Volchkova, have dismissed the SES as a &#8220;political project.&#8221; Russia has little to gain in terms of economic benefits because the economies of member states are too small, and Russia already has a strong foothold in them, Volchkova said. The integration is also unlikely to lead to mutual growth of direct investment among member countries. \"Russia should not expect to gain new technologies from member states as a result of integration,&#8221; Volchkova said. Moreover, in order to lure countries like Belarus to the SES, Moscow has agreed to unprecedented concessions, such as supplying oil to the country without levying a duty in exchange for Minsk&#8217;s revenues from export duties on oil products, a move experts say could cost the Russian budget up to $2 billion a year. &#8220;In order to further its regional ambition, the Russian leadership has had to pay the high price of economic concessions to member countries,&#8221; Volchkova said.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eA man builds his own factory in the suburbs of Yekaterinburg  to produce polymer film. The plant employs cutting-edge technology and the  latest in modern logistics systems. This man is not one to take short cuts. Before this, he had been in adhesives, worked in  metallurgical waste recycling and held jobs as a tailor and as a trader. The  man in question has had to adapt his commercial projects to a changing reality  to come out on top in various adverse situations, and this has shaped the way  he is today. Alexei Goncharov, owner of a chain of factories, spent a day with Russky Reporter&#8217;s Alexei Torgashev talking  about his life, his career and his plans for the future. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eWhen I first started, I literally had nothing. My  first project was textiles. You name it, we made it: clothes, curtains,  anything. At first I had people working from home, then I got a studio, and  when the business took off, we opened big tailoring factories. We sold what we  made wherever we could, at the market, from the back of cars, or in shops. This  was all back in 1990-1991. In the early nineties there were plenty of  people who could make things, but hardly anyone knew how to sell their goods.  At the same time, people were hungry for new goods, and I could see what would  work. Whatever you were selling at this time, the minimum profit you&#8217;d make  would be about 150 percent; a few times we even made 1,000 percent. So, how did it happen? You&#8217;re there having a cup of tea  with someone, and he says: &#8216;There&#8217;s quite an interesting opportunity here. The  difficulty is getting hold of this kind of material. But if we could work it  out we&#8217;d be looking at 500 percent net.&#8217; You have to line up for an hour to get  the material, and the fabric producer has a monopoly on this business and is a  pretty sketchy character to boot. But I came up with a solution whereby we got  the material, and no money even changed hands. If you&#8217;re an entrepreneur, you can make money out of thin  air, but you have to be able to think through a million different risks and  outcome. I have come all this way on my own, no one helped me to get where I am  today.  We saw a niche in the market and we filled it &#8211; we  decided to go into packaging. Uralplastik is an old factory. I bought out its  shares. Buying the factory was not a decision I took lightly; it involved huge  risk. But if I hadn&#8217;t taken the plunge and bought it, you would never have  heard of me today. Of course I wasn&#8217;t alone in this; I had a lot of  professional assistance in the form of lawyers, a PR team and securities  specialists. When you&#8217;re working on a big scale like this, it&#8217;s a matter of  your people being more on the ball than the people they are negotiating with. I became the owner of Uralplastik, and we revamped the  Japanese production line that had been installed back in perestroika. We bought  new equipment with our own money and loans from people we knew. This was  because the interest rates on loans in the late 1990s, early 2000s were  stupidly high, and building a production business on borrowed money would have  been pretty much out of the question. Actually the situation today (with rates  of 10 to 18 percent) is not much better. This is perhaps why the Russian market  is dominated by big conglomerates and small and medium-sized businesses, the  ones that generally require new equipment, are fairly thin on the ground.  The main philosophy of production should be as follows:  Production should happen without people. People should only be employed to  provide a service: to give training, do repairs, work in shops and restaurants,  to apply their knowledge in some direction, trade, build &#8211; in short everything  that most of the world&#8217;s population do to earn a living. If we want to see a  lot of cheap, high-quality goods on our shelves, the production process needs  to be automated and operate without people. In turn this would create a lot of  jobs in the service sector. But at the moment the situation in Russia is completely the  opposite. With the factory I am building at the moment, for example, I can&#8217;t  buy anything here in Russia, everything needs to be imported from abroad, and  there are no trustworthy contractors here either, it&#8217;s hard to find one that  gets it right the first time. It&#8217;s easy to forget that Russia is not Europe &#8211; you  introduce new technology, only to find that the market is still not ready for  it. People in Russia have very conservative tastes, and producers are wary of  introducing new, better-quality goods to the market. Of course everything  catches on in time, but in general we are still about 10 years behind the West,  and this is simply because it takes longer for the Russian consumer to accept  new products. In my opinion, this is an area where the government could step in  and educate people. Competition in Russia is hindered by a somewhat sheep-like  attitude toward business. No one is thinking up new ideas, people just look out  for what seems to be doing well and follow suit. As soon as we launched our  factory, copycat businesses started cropping up everywhere and before long  there were six factories like ours nearby. &#8220;The rules and regulations of Russian customs offices are  the main obstacle to the development of Russian business. They may have  introduced 0 percent import rates for foreign equipment, but the rules are set  out so that foreign companies have to spend two months doing paperwork to be  able to supply me with equipment. &#8220;Most raw materials used in industry are imported from  abroad. But at the same time, this raw material has huge stamp duties placed on  it. So in most cases it works out a lot cheaper to import prepared goods. &#8220;We need to change the way we think. The young people we  hire have often lost faith in the system, complaining at how much these  bureaucrats seem to earn. &#8220;I am a businessman and a global citizen. I don&#8217;t feel  attached to any particular place, and I live where I work. My time off is spent  on a motorbike, playing golf or skiing. I have a Honda and a Harley, both of  which I treasure. I&#8217;ve been pretty much everywhere in the world, sometimes in  company, sometimes on my own. Being abroad makes me see Russia more objectively. In  Africa, for example, I discovered that Africans have a lot in common with  Russians: Both would like to live without having to work. But I still think  about the fate of Russia. And I have decided that it is to always be on the  sidelines. As soon as we start to move forward, someone always comes along and  pulls us back to a standstill. And now we have the chance to overcome these  obstacles and make headway on the path of development. This is going to take a  lot of effort, but in reality, this is because the Russian market is still a  void.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eFinding good wine at a reasonable price in Russia is like finding a   needle in a haystack, while limited growth in demand, new alcohol   consumption rules and even the changing winds of international politics   have all complicated the import industry in recent years. About 50.2 million gallons of wine were imported in the first nine   months of 2011, making up nearly one-third of the total market, and   roughly equaling the amount imported for the same period last year. There has been growth over the last decade, with foreign players   expanding consumer options. Since 2001, Spain has increased its share of   the import market from 1 percent to 15.2 percent while France has grown   from 5.6 percent to be the current leader, with 21.9 percent. Most of   the changes in market share, however, have come at the cost of Georgian   and Moldovan imports which were banned in 2006. Regardless of the country of origin, industry players say price is the largest stumbling block to increasing consumption. &#8220;What you have here on the market is very cheap American wine,&#8221; said   Sylvia Nestorov, an avid wine enthusiast who moved to Russia from   California. &#8220;Then you have the very expensive and honestly not the best   taste. And some of the good ones &#8212; but they have nothing in between.&#8221; Disgusted with high prices and low quality, in August Nestorov began   importing wines from Sonoma Valley to share with the local market   through her business, Wines of California. However, a low demand for wine discourages competition in an industry   where vodka and beer dominate the market. According to a 2011 survey by   RosBusinessConsulting, 60 percent of Russians drink beer, 49 percent   drink vodka and only 26 percent drink wine. &#8220;Low [average] monthly wages are another major hindrance to the   growth of the wine industry,&#8221; said Vadim Drobiz, director of the   Research Center for Federal and&#8239;Regional Alcohol Markets. &#8220;Because of   the differences in average wage, wine in Russia is, relatively, four to   five times more expensive than in Europe.&#8221; Besides low average incomes, resellers seek large profits at the consumer&#8217;s cost.  &#8220;My [midrange] bottles worth 6.5 to 7 euros ($9) sometimes go for 80   ($107) in the stores,&#8221; said Kamyar Vossoughi, sales manager for Scriani   Italian wines. &#8220;I sell my best wine at this price.&#8221; On average, boutiques and restaurants place a markup on price four times the cost, Nestorov said. As a result of these factors, in the first nine months of this year   beer sales reached 8.2 billion liters, vodka sales hit 1.1 billion   liters while only 700 million liters of wine &#8212; both imported and   domestic &#8212; were sold, which is down from about 840 million liters sold   in the same period last year.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eForming a &#8220;culture&#8221; for consuming wine and alcoholic beverages and   &#8220;establishing a tradition of civilized promotion and responsible   consumption,&#8221; were the drivers for the Russian Chamber of Commerce and   Industry to organize the first Moscow International Wine Expo at the end   of October, said chamber vice president Georgy Petrov. Over 40 companies from 11 countries took part in the event, including   legendary British wine critic and Decanter editor Steven Spurrier. It was an event welcomed by the industry, which was enduring a   difficult year. In January, the Federal Alcohol Regulation Service   ordered local alcoholic beverage manufacturers to undergo a safety check   of their production standards, while at the same time many distributors   were going through the license renewal process. &#8220;The number of liquor and wine producers in Russia dropped by about   40 percent and distributors by about 50 percent in the past year and a   half,&#8221; said Drobiz of the Research Center for Federal and&#8239;Regional   Alcohol Markets. &#8220;It has caused major problems in logistics for   distributors, wholesalers and producers.&#8221; Drobiz said the contraction is due to an &#8220;internal crisis&#8221; aimed at   reducing competition by weeding out weaker players. &#8220;Government policies   aim to make Russia a global player by reducing the number of producers   and distributors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Wine producers should &#8230; fight against this   policy.&#8221;  The authorities have their own view of how the wine industry should develop. &#8220;Throughout the entire world, the alcohol market is made up of   [monopolies],&#8221; said Viktor Zvagelsky, a Duma deputy and chairman of the   subcommittee on regulation of excisable goods, in an interview with   Navigator-Kirov.ru. &#8220;Even in countries where the government places much more focus on   monopolistic practices, alcohol production is controlled by big   business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Small and medium businesses are not capable of   producing high-quality alcohol.&#8221; Industry experts do not agree, and emphasize the importance of small   players in both making and dealing in wine. &#8220;It is important to have   small, young importers,&#8221; Italian wine producer Giovanni Laconis told The   Moscow Times. &#8220;I was in Britain, and there is a rising trend of 27- to   30-year-old guys with new ideas. Here big importers have a monopoly, and   if you&#8217;re not a famous brand, it is hard to sell your product.&#8221;  New importers are also discouraged from entering the market because of the tediously long licensing process. After sending in paperwork, recommendations and expert analyses,   Mirko Lucio Furia, co-owner of Salva Terra, an Italian wine producer   seeking to enter the market, said he would wait six to eight months just   to receive a reply from the federal authorities. Nestorov said it took her 2.5 years to obtain all of the necessary licensing paperwork. &#8220;It is very bureaucratic,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t know the right   people, it is very difficult &#8212; almost impossible to even become an   importer.&#8221; International producers are also feeling the effects of the local   market turbulence. At an Italian wine show in Moscow this fall, Bertania   marketing director Mateja Gravner said their previous Russian   distributor had abruptly stopped placing orders without providing any   explanation at all.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eA new bill passed in July bans the sale of alcohol above 0.5 percent   from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m. Currently beer is not considered an alcoholic   beverage, but next summer the government is expected to redefine its   status. &#8220;The enactment [of the law] puts alcoholic beverages of different   types at equal terms,&#8221; said Natalya Schenyaeva, communications manager   at Diageo, a global alcohol producer of leading brands, including   Smirnoff and Johnnie Walker. However, the customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan may extinguish these hopes. &#8220;Currently 80 percent of the Belarussian beer market is packaged in   plastic,&#8221; a source in the Belarus beer industry who requested to remain   anonymous, told RosBusinessConsulting. &#8220;The new policy will force   producers to invest an enormous sum to repackage their product into   glass bottles.&#8221; The Belarussian state committee on standards, the Tax Ministry and   the brewers&#8217; trade association support the development of a special   category for beer, separate from wine.  Foreign policy has also influenced imports. Early in October, Russia&#8217;s consumer protection chief Gennady Onishchenko   hinted at lifting a ban on Georgian wines and mineral waters that had   been in place since 2006 &#8212; following Georgia&#8217;s threats to thwart   Russia&#8217;s WTO aspirations. At the time, Georgian and Moldovan wines had a   combined 60 percent share of the imported wine market. On Oct. 29, just days after Georgia and Russia came to an agreement   on issues surrounding WTO accession, Onishchenko met with Georgy   Piliyevy, the owner of the Georgian cognac producer Saradzhishvili in   Moscow. Following the meeting, Onishchenko said, &#8220;We agreed on   everything, and now are only waiting upon the presentation of   documents,&#8221; Interfax reported. Onishchenko also threatened to end imports of cognac from Moldova&#8217;s   Transdnestr region last month, the day after the Kremlin made it clear   it felt that the leader of the disputed region should not seek   re-election. Georgian wine has been banned from the Russian market since 2006,   while Moldovan wine has periodically been banned since that year as   well. Despite the obstacles facing the wine industry, foreign producers are   still clamoring to enter the market. &#8220;Russians are ready and wanting to   develop a wine culture,&#8221; said Mirko Lucio Furia, co-owner of Salva   Terra, an Italian wine producer. &#8220;And I want to help open that world to   them.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eBetween $60 billion and $65 billion is being invested each year on major renovation  projects across the country &#8211; not that you&#8217;d notice if you visit Russia&#8217;s  regional capitals, which still look drab and run-down, bar a few brightly  coloured billboards. That&#8217;s because most of the money is going into transport  and power systems &#8211; the lifeblood of this vast but largely empty country. Infrastructure investment in Russia  in 2010 reached $111 billion, according to a report by Morgan Stanley, a  10-fold increase from the $7 billion spent in 1999. Commentators regularly attack the Kremlin&#8217;s &#8220;spending frenzy&#8221;, claiming it has  driven up the oil price needed to balance the budget to over $125 a barrel &#8211;  from $21 in 2007, based on Citigroup figures. But they don&#8217;t seem to  acknowledge that, rather than propping up struggling factories or paying public  servants, the money is going on much-needed infrastructure projects. And, when  set against the rapidly expanding economy, the spending splurge is not that  much: as a share of GDP it has doubled from 3.5 percent of GDP in 1999 to 7 percent in 2010  &#8211; slightly ahead of India&#8217;s  6 percent, but well behind China&#8217;s  11 percent. What&#8217;s more, it isn&#8217;t just the federal government making the investment, but  state-owned companies, many of which are now on the privatisation list. Over  half of all infrastructure investment (3.7 percent  of GDP) was made by just eight  large state-owned companies, while federal budget spending accounted for only  1.8 percent, according to Morgan Stanley. The real boom in infrastructure spending, though, has not even begun. A host of  mega-projects are being prepared that will push the spending even higher over  the next couple of years. Among the biggest projects planned are the development of the Vankor oil and  gas field, the biggest find in Russia in the past 25 years; the Ust-Luga port  in the Gulf of Finland that will be the biggest warm-water port in Russia; the  reconstruction of the Black Sea resort of Sochi ahead of the 2014 Winter  Olympics; and the construction of the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean (Espo) oil  pipeline. Morgan Stanley estimates that a total of $500 billion worth of infrastructure  projects are underway or about to start. &#8220;Based on our major projects database,  we see a steady $60 billion - $65 billion  [per year] flow of infrastructure capital  expenditure on major projects, and a new generation of mega-projects under  development, including high- speed rail, new federal highways, the Moscow  transport hub and further development of the Yamal oil and gas province,&#8221; says  Jacob Nell, chief economist of Morgan Stanley and author of the report. To sustain this high level of development, Mr Nell estimates state-owned  companies will have to raise another $28 billion  a year to finance the work &#8211; about as  much as Russia  attracts in foreign direct investment. What is odd is that much of this work has gone unnoticed. This is partly  because the spending has not had much impact on the country&#8217;s growth or overall  investment &#8211; both are now lower than before the financial crisis began. And  because the more opaque state-owned companies are in the front line, their  spending is harder to see than federal budget spending or privately funded  investment. But perhaps the biggest factor is that, unlike China  and India, which were both  largely agrarian economies, Russia  inherited a lot of serviceable infrastructure from the Soviet era. In the boom  years of the Seventies, when the workers&#8217; paradise looked like it might  actually happen, Kremlin spending on infrastructure averaged 40 percent of GDP a  year. It was only in the Nineties that it fell away to next to nothing. &#8220;Russia inherited  significant elements of a modern industrial infrastructure from the Soviet Union, including an oil and gas industry, a mining  industry, a railway network, a power network, and urban transport and municipal  services. However, the infrastructure was often inefficient, and there were  notable gaps, particularly in telecommunications and transport,&#8221; says Mr Nell.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

What is essential, however, is   that money must be invested in the region&#8217;s economy, new jobs must be   created  and taxes paid. Meanwhile, we have to  always bear in mind that potential investors include so called chancers &#8211;  intermediaries who promise the earth but deliver nothing. I used to deal with  quite a few of them: they introduced themselves as representatives of certain  companies acting under powers of attorney and promised huge financial benefits.  Truth be told, I got carried away with the projects, but as we went deeper into  it to thrash out the details, it would usually turn out to be pure fiction.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat new investment projects are planned for the Orel region in the next few years?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eWe are now in talks over five relatively big  investment projects. The first one involves a production facility to be  opened by the  German agricultural equipment producer Amazone &#8211; one of the global leaders in  the sphere. The company&#8217;s owners have already set their sights on a certain  factory, and I hope the project will be launched in 2012. The second project  envisages the creation of a major logistics hub in the region by Russia&#8217;s top  retailer X5 Retail Group. The retailer found our proposal attractive, and we  are 90 percent certain of its positive decision on the logistics center. The third project involves  the reconstruction of the Orel  railway station in conjunction with Russian Railways to transform it into a  transport hub and a business center. Negotiations are proceeding  successfully, and the project will start receiving financing next year.  The fourth project focuses  on the development of an animal breeding cluster &#8211; pig breeding, to be precise.  We have completed talks with the Cherkizovo Group, which is planning to build  another pig breeding farm here next year. The fifth project is linked  to the construction of two cattle farms by Miratorg Agribusiness Holding, one  of the leaders in livestock breeding. The total investment in the project is  estimated at over 2 billion rubles. There is yet another  important project involving the creation of an industrial park in the region.  In April 2011, the governor approved a long-term program on encouraging  investment activities, featuring an industrial park as one of its crucial  elements.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat  companies are you looking for, and in what industries do they work?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eWe are primarily looking for companies  operating in the high-tech, machine-building and instrument engineering  industries, computing  technology, metal working and, possibly, food processing.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003eterms can you offer\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eFirst of all, we  offer investors preferential lease terms on land for the construction period,  and when the construction work is completed, the investor will be entitled to  purchase the plot.

The company had just launched a $70-million joint venture (Ural  Boeing Manufacturing) to construct aircraft components with local company  VSMPO-AVISMA, the world&#8217;s largest producer of titanium. Eighteen billion  dollars of the proposed investment was earmarked for acquiring titanium  products. Two years later, several titanium  components for Boeing&#8217;s Dreamliner jet, as well as landing gear beams for the  737, are manufactured in the Sverdlovsk region  before they are shipped to Boeing&#8217;s factory in Portland, Ore.,  for final assembly. &#8220;The efforts of the Sverdlovsk regional authorities to create a positive  investment climate have not only allowed one of Russia&#8217;s oldest titanium  manufacturers to lead a major modernization of their production facilities,  they have also provided the opportunity for international industrial  integration,&#8221; commented Ural Boeing Manufacturing General Director Gary  Kessler. Despite producing 25 percent of the world&#8217;s titanium and being a major  supplier to Boeing and EADS, VSMPO-AVISMA remains little known outside Russia. The local capital of Yekaterinburg, an  industrial hub with more than one million citizens, has a relationship with the  United States - and France - that  goes back to the 19th century, when the Ural region supplied the metal for the  frame of the Statue of Liberty. A strategic closed city of the Soviet defense industry, Yekaterinburg opened up  its doors to international manufacturing giants in the mid 1990s in an attempt  to reorient defense production. American firms currently lead the way with $1.8  billion in trade turnover in 2010 alone, with major investments coming from  companies like 3M and Hewlett Packard. &#8220;Unlike in Moscow,  there aren&#8217;t that many American companies operating in Yekaterinburg,&#8221;  commented Igor Chernogolov, president of Penetron Russia. &#8220;That&#8217;s why regional  authorities give us a lot of attention.&#8221; Forbes magazine recently ranked Sverdlovsk  the second most attractive Russian region for foreign investors. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin  unveiled the formation of a &#8220;Titanium   Valley&#8221; special economic  zone in the region to attract foreign investment. The project will involve $530 million in federal investments, with the hope of  creating 15,000 jobs.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eSince 2005, breeding of agricultural livestock in Russia has  taken off, and now many sectors of the industry have reached their saturation  point. As a result, investors are working to develop products for niche  markets, such as marble beef or bacon for the catering industry. Their record  so far has not been particularly impressive, but there is one startling  exception&#8211; turkey. Between 2006 and 2010, the number of turkeys in Russia has  quadrupled and domestically produced turkey products now exceed the total  number imported. This year, Russian and foreign agricultural authorities expect  still greater growth, believing that the market will expand in the medium term.  The turkey market may produce higher quality goods when compared to the chicken  market, but chicken production began earlier and has thus far been the most  successful livestock-breeding sector. The success of the turkey industry is all the more notable due  to the fact that it has been built up virtually from scratch. During the Soviet  era, turkey production (or consumption, for that matter) did not exist in  Russia, and the animals were raised mainly on small, private plots of land. With a $250 million operation in the  Rostov Region, Evrodon Group is the indisputable  leader of the Russian turkey business. Evrodon chief Vadim Vaneyev spoke with  Ivan Rubanov of \u0027Ekspert\u0027 magazine about his company&#8217;s operations.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTurkey was your first major business venture. Where did  you get the starting capital? How much of it was borrowed capital?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAlmost 100 percent was borrowed. We used money  from the bank for project financing. We started construction in 2006 and the  first unit had a capacity of 12,000 metric tons of meat, which cost 41 million  euros ($53 million) to build. That was the costliest stage of the project, as  we had to obtain land rights and lay down the infrastructure. The second phase  was much cheaper. Now the complex has reached its design capacity of 30,200 tons  and, by next spring, we are going to increase it by another 4,000 tons to  complete the operation. It was entirely a grassroots project. Turkeys are not robust  birds and are vulnerable to every kind of infection. Naturally the facilities  are separated, and we comply fully with all regulation so it is easy for us at  any time to get a European Union certificate to export. In terms of technology,  the only remaining issue is the droppings. Currently farmers steal them because  historically turkey droppings have been viewed as waste and were considered  worthless; however, they contain a large amount of phosphorus, which increases  yields by a quarter percent. We are choosing treatment technologies for that  by-product in order to make money from it, too.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhere did you find the workforce? Who selected the  appropriate technology for Russia&#8217;s climate?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eEighty percent of our workers are locals. We looked for  medium and top-level managers from all over the former Soviet Union. For  example, we recruited the chief technologist for turkey breeding in Uzbekistan.  The core workforce was retrained abroad and then they trained the younger  people. We have a constant exchange of experience; our veterans go to Europe,  our managers visit foreign farms and vice versa; we have foreigners arriving  every month. The equipment and engineering solutions were provided by the  Israelis, but only during the initial stages. In late 2006 after putting the  first unit in place, which had a capacity for 12,000 tons of meat, the price  for cement shot up in Russia. We faced funding problems, and so had to separate  the company from our [Israeli] partners. We finished the facilities ourselves  with our own know-how, including the engineering work. Since 2008, we have been  building all of our projects independently. If we had outsourced the construction, it would have been 30  percent to 50 percent more expensive; moreover, I was not sure whether my  turkey houses would be standing in ten years using outsourced services. As for  technological solutions, we have used our own experience, our own brains and  have traveled across the world in order to see how others run their businesses.  Thirty percent of the project&#8217;s second phase is all-Russian technology,  including thermal insulation solutions.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDo you mostly produce or process meat? And in general,  does Russia&#8217;s sales structure differ significantly from the West&#8217;s?  \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAbout 90 percent of our meat is supplied in cut form. A  small percentage is provided as whole carcasses (mainly females) and in the  shape of sausages, of which we produce 25 types. Our market differs from the  American one, where about 50 percent of turkeys are consumed whole on  Thanksgiving Day. That is why light and medium-weight turkeys are popular over  there, while the heavier ones are most in demand here; However, there is a  growing tradition of buying whole turkeys at Easter and the New Year. In the  future we want to increase our market share of processed products, including  finished foods. We use our own feed recipes. Despite foreigners constantly  offering us all kinds of additives, we do not give them to our birds&#8211; our  reputation is more important to us. There was an amusing episode recently: A  general manager from the British company that developed one of the breeds that  we are using came to visit us. He tasted our meat and then tasted it again and  again before asking, &#8220;May I take all of it back home with me?&#8221; He collected all  of the pieces from the plates on the table and grabbed another five kilos in  the slaughterhouse. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never tasted anything so good back home,&#8221; he said. We held anonymous meat tasting sessions, which included meat from  our rivals, and everybody immediately identified our product.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat is your approximate cost structure?  \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eFeed accounts for 68 percent of our costs. That includes  soy pellets and forage grain (Each constitutes about 30 percent of the total)  as well as maize, barley, premixes and vitamin additives. 13 ingredients in  all.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYour ambitions might surprise even an experienced  professional. Do you, as a businessman, have any dreams?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eTo become the number one turkey producer in the world.  Your magazine recently wrote that we [Russia] need global companies. We have no  chance of overtaking foreigners on beef production given our costs. Regarding  pork, China is the undisputed leader. In the States, there are giant poultry  breeding companies. Turkey is the niche market where we can become a global  leader.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis is an abridged version of the article, which was first  published in Russian in the journal &#8220;Ekspert.&#8221;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

One of the  latest companies to join is IBM, which has signed agreements to drive  innovation in Russia and establish a science and technology centre employing up  to 170 technical staff by the end of 2012. IBM and Skolkovo plan collaborations on areas of mutual interest, including the  oil and gas industries, and business analytics technologies to improve road  safety. Construction of the innovation centre only began a year ago, and there is  still much work to be done. But despite it being a work in progress, the  founders have high hopes that it will become not only the engine of the Russian  economy, but a major player in global research and development. Sceptics have branded the whole concept a pipe dream, but as more and more  big-name companies sign up, their criticism appears increasingly misplaced. The place is already making its mark in the Russian consciousness. Skolkovo as  a brand is widely known; it is responsible for more words with the prefix  &#8220;nano&#8221; popping up in everyday language, along with the use of the buzzwords  &#8220;innovation&#8221; and &#8220;modernisation&#8221;. Skolkovo has also revived an older Russian acronym: NIOKR, which is basically  the Russian equivalent of R&D. It refers to a full-cycle research centre  where scientists come up with a new technology, build a pilot product, test it,  and, if the test is successful, launch it into mass production. In the US,  $382.6bn (&#163;245.6bn) or 2.7pc of its GDP, is spent each year on research and  development. In contrast, Russian firms currently spend just a little over  $23bn, which is 1pc of GDP. Skolkovo&#8217;s ambitious managers are trying to create a framework that will  attract foreign companies to carry out cutting-edge research. Roman Romanovsky,  Skolkovo&#8217;s operating director for key partners, says: &#8220;Our main task now is to  create the most comfortable conditions and environment. Innovation centres are  usually thought to be exclusively aimed at start-ups, but that&#8217;s not the case.  Nor are we committed only to corporate research. We seek to make the circulation  of ideas at Skolkovo constant, so that everyone can find what they come here  for. Major companies would get young talent, start-ups would meet investors and  investors would get promising new ideas, and so on.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eMany foreign companies have already signed agreements to open research centres  at Skolkovo, while others have given verbal assurances of participation. In  addition to IBM, the German electronics giant Siemens has signed an agreement  for the phased development of its operations in Skolkovo. By 2015, it will have  a staff of 150 at the centre. The total joint investments will be about $80m,  with $50m to be put up by Siemens and $30m by Skolkovo Foundation grants. &#8220;For us, [Skolkovo] is interesting as a pilot project that will transform  Russia&#8217;s future,&#8221; says Alexander Averyanov, head of the Siemens project at  Skolkovo. &#8220;It&#8217;s no coincidence that Siemens CEO Peter L&#246;scher is a member of  the Skolkovo Foundation Board. We are also co-operating with the foundation to  promote the Skolkovo brand around the world, and are dealing with the  infrastructure issues.&#8221; Siemens has not disclosed any details of the project, but it is likely to be  related to radioisotope diagnosis. The first grant of more than $4m has already  been issued for the research project. Nokia, Finland&#8217;s mobile phone giant, has a somewhat different vision of its  partnership with the foundation, with a focus on inventing and introducing  inline production of everyday devices. &#8220;[Skolkovo Foundation Head Viktor]  Vekselberg and I signed an agreement confirming the specific stages of the  centre&#8217;s development,&#8221; says Nokia representative Tatiana Oberemova. &#8220;The centre  will develop powerful mobile computing systems and offer solutions in the field  of nanotechnology. Nokia&#8217;s investments in the centre amount to a double-digit  number in the millions of euros, which is the standard budget for Nokia&#8217;s  R&D centres.&#8221; The Nokia project is planned to develop at a dizzying pace: the construction  contract was signed in June and the building was due to be completed in  December. Nokia hopes to construct laboratories and also wants to develop  large-scale commercialisation projects involving mass production of electronic  devices using nanotechnology. Nokia&#8217;s competitor Ericsson sees Skolkovo as an excellent platform for research  in the sphere of telecommunications, cloud and telematics technologies. Its  first research effort will be smart power supply networks designed to save  energy. These smart meters installed into phones will allow users to constantly  provide information to distribution companies, allowing both the company and  the consumer to monitor consumption patterns more closely. Ericsson vice-president Mikhail Podoprygalov, who specialises in work with  government agencies, says: &#8220;There was a lot of talk about the need to develop  our economy, non-commodity exports, and now we have a place, an ecosystem where  this can be accomplished.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eBut not everyone has been so positive about Skolkovo&#8217;s potential. Timofei  Shatskikh, a financial analyst with RosBusinessConsulting, says: &#8220;Until the  first project is implemented, in the minds of most Russians, not to mention  domestic investors, it will remain just another ambitious government idea. &#8220;People don&#8217;t see Skolkovo as a scientific institution, but rather as a political  one aimed at projecting a positive image. Even the foundation&#8217;s established  partnerships with Western companies cannot dissuade them of this. Until the  first scientific idea that germinated within the walls of Skolkovo is presented,  that opinion won&#8217;t change. The creation of several R&D centres may rectify  the situation. Then you can at least argue that the generation of new ideas  will happen serially.&#8221; Bright Capital fund&#8217;s Vadim Kulikov disagrees. &#8220;By attracting private  investments, Skolkovo shows that not only Russia&#8217;s president, but also the  market believes in the project,&#8221; he says. According to the chief investment officer of the Skolkovo Foundation, Alexander  Lupachev, the Foundation has raised $265m from 22 ventures and direct  investment funds, and it has already invested $70m in a number of new ventures. These figures are proof enough that the innovation centre is a reality and not  just a concept.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eLars H&#229;kan Danielsson,  50, has taken a step that not many would be willing to take &#8211; the Swede has  become the head of German financial giant Allianz&#8217;s Russian operations, moving away from  a familiar life in his native Sweden  to Russia,  a country that he doesn&#8217;t know. A job in Russia  is a new challenge, something a top manager really needs, Danielsson admits &#8211;  especially one who has never worked in Russia or with Allianz. Danielsson  spoke with Russian daily Vedomosti daily about his thoughts and plans for the future  as well as how Allianz will consolidate its position in the Russian market.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow do you like Russia?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eI love it here. I can&#8217;t say that I had a  clear picture of the country, but there haven&#8217;t been many surprises. Most of  them have been pleasant. Russians are indeed very  friendly, kind, always ready to help and very generous. Of course you may ask,  &#8220;Who would ever want to come here from Sweden to run a company?&#8221; The truth  is, this country has very good people. And I became even more sure of this when  I went to the regions. The way they welcome you and entertain you, it&#8217;s all  very pleasant.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat about unpleasant surprises?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eIt seems that people in  Russia  can&#8217;t work in teams; they tend to take an individualistic approach. The  bosses here are all very strong and competent people, but they don&#8217;t always  succeed in making the most of their employees&#8217; skills and knowledge. I was  expecting this, but probably not to this extent. I&#8217;ve never worked in Russia before, but I have worked in neighboring  countries &#8211; Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The situations here and  there are not very different, but this tendency is more conspicuous here. An  important task for me is to unite people, make them work in a team. Another  small surprise was that the difference in corporate culture between the three  Allianz companies in Russia  (Allianz, Rosno and Progress-Garant) proved to be more pronounced than I had  expected.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eOver the last few years, some foreign investors have wound down their  insurance business in Russia.  Will Allianz be following suit?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eNo: we&#8217;re moving in the opposite direction, we&#8217;re growing our  business. We believe that the Russian market has potential.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWould you say that Allianz is taking a bullish stance  on the Russian market?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThey wouldn&#8217;t like that expression in Munich. Allianz is a pretty conservative  company. It may be better to grow gradually in a managed way rather than try to  take things by storm. Many aggressive companies come and go, but we&#8217;ve been in  the market for 100 years and will stay. I like the words &#8220;purposeful&#8221; and  &#8220;determined&#8221; more, because Allianz is determined to develop its business in Russia.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat is Allianz&#8217;s strategy in Russia now?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAs a percentage of Allianz&#8217;s entire business, the operations  in Russia  aren&#8217;t very big. On the other hand, I&#8217;m convinced that as long as the European  crisis continues, the growth potential in economies with saturated markets is  very limited. But companies have to grow. It&#8217;s like riding a bike &#8211; if you fail  to accelerate, you won&#8217;t succeed. Therefore, growth markets are very important,  because that&#8217;s where the growth opportunities are concentrated. Shareholders  want to see growth and profits, and in this context we are very important.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRussian business is often short of transparency;  kickbacks and other corrupt practices are routine here. How do you think we  should combat them?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eIt would be a mistake to think that other countries have  fully transparent business, free from bribes and fraud. But for Russia, it&#8217;s a  more universal problem than for most of the markets where I&#8217;ve worked. However,  I&#8217;m not sure whether the problem here is worse than say, in Latvia. And  this is a huge risk for a company like Allianz, because we have no options  other than to work transparently. It means that from time to time we will have  to say &#8216;no&#8217; to the market, which reduces growth potential and is thus a serious  issue. The Russian market works for a commission. There are many payments in  cash and many personal sales. This combination creates many opportunities like  those that you have described. How can we fight this? I think the only way in  the long term is to develop Russian society. Insurance is integrated into the  life of society. There will never be any separate rules for insurance and  society. There are two reasons for this: the first is economic development,  because the more we develop, the more bank transfers and fewer cash payments  take place. Second is the development and improvement of the legislative  system. Strict market control is also essential. All of this work is underway.  It seems to me that the process is a bit too slow, but it&#8217;s moving in the right  direction. I believe there&#8217;s also one more reason: the lack of trust. Sometimes  there is no trust in companies, and sometimes there is no trust in people.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRussia  wants to build an international financial center in the Moscow region. What do you think about this?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eIt&#8217;s a very interesting project. There are many candidate  cities for the creation of a financial center in the world. Even such a small  city as Stockholm  wants to be one. I took an active part in this initiative in Stockholm &#8211; I was a member of a management  panel that included representatives of financial institutions, the city,  Swedish state agencies, etc. What about the infrastructure? What about taxes?  What about specialists? What about the legal system? All these issues must be  tackled. I think that two things are critical if Moscow is to succeed: The first is raising  long-term capital. Long-term investments form  the foundation. If you only have one or two direct investment funds, they will  not be enough for the foundation; you need long-term capital. It&#8217;s good that  owners of these funds are faced with serious difficulties over where to invest.  Should they invest in state bonds?  Fine, they offer a high interest rate.   But how can I be sure that they&#8217;ll pay? Or I&#8217;m sure that they&#8217;ll pay, but the  rate is miserly. Joint ventures with the state are good examples of long-term  investments. These can include the construction of airports, roads or prisons.  This combination is very good.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYou mean large infrastructure projects?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eYes. Setting up a real pension insurance system would be a  good start, because it means long money. You receive money for 20, 30 or  sometimes 40 years. The second thing is education  and professionalism, because if you&#8217;ve got long-term capital and good people,  you have an excellent foundation. This won&#8217;t guarantee immediate success,  though. Additionally, it is important to develop rules and make sure that  they&#8217;re predictable. If you want to have long-term capital, you need to ensure  a predictable development of the regulatory framework and supervisory system. I  want to be sure that the situation will not change dramatically within five  years if I decide to move in this direction.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe consistency and transparency of the rules of the  game are pressing problems for Russia.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eIt&#8217;s relevant for other countries as well. You know, I once  visited Guernsey, which attracts substantial  capital. The place is a sort of small town. I met with the finance minister,  who told me, &#8220;We haven&#8217;t changed a single rule for investors over the last 15  years.&#8221;\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"Title": "IMF: Russia needs new shock therapy",
				"Author": "Andrew Roth, Russia Profile",
				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAs foreign investors in Russia look warily at the country&#8217;s growing   political instability, a potentially devastating crisis in Europe may   take its own toll on the Russian economy as well. Last week, the   International Monetary Fund released a statement projecting slowing   growth in Russia and said its outlook has &#8220;significant downside risks as   a worsening euro area crisis could trigger a global downturn.&#8221; Analysts   agreed that Russian growth is likely to slow in the coming year, but   there is no consensus yet on whether the country is better prepared for   an external shock than it was before the 2008 financial crisis. The IMF reduced its predictions for growth in Russia from 4.1 percent   this year to 3.5 percent in 2012 due to a likely drop in commodity   prices in the coming year. Yet Europe, and by extension Russia, has   cause for hope. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor   Angela Merkel championed a drive last week to limit debt accumulation in   a number of EU countries to convince the European Central Bank to   continue bailing out local economies. Markets reacted positively to the   news, but, as The Economist noted on December 10, there are concerns   those same markets will &#8220;rally on the news of a deal that peters out   once investors examine the fine print.&#8221; Russia, too, has cause   for hope. As the IMF report noted, the country is, in many ways, better   prepared for a crisis than in 2008: banks in Russia have little direct   exposure to the debt market in Europe; the Russian economy is not   currently &#8220;overheating&#8221; as it was several years ago; and the government   has extended some of its institutional capabilities to bail out banks at   critical moments. Nonetheless, some experts said that Russian growth   will likely slow more than the IMF predicted. Ivan Tchakarov, chief   economist for Russia & CIS at Renaissance Capital, projected Russian   growth at just 2.5 percent in 2012, saying the IMF was &#8220;likely taking   an optimistic position to avoid shocking the market.&#8221; Russia&#8217;s   exposure to a European economic slowdown or collapse remains twofold,   said Alfa Bank Chief Economist Natalya Orlova. The first is a possible   drop in prices for commodities as foreign economies grind to a halt. The   second is that as crisis looms over Europe, foreign investors are   taking their money out of Russia in order to hedge their risk, making it   more expensive to borrow.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eA key step for the Russian government   would be to reduce its fiscal deficit, said the IMF, yet a series of   pre-election promises by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on social   spending are unlikely to be called off in the heat of Russia&#8217;s current   political turmoil. Reducing pensions, for instance, could push elderly   voters away from United Russia, as could cutting salaries for other   government workers. Putin, in particular, has built his reputation as a   guarantor of stability and economic growth, but if that trend reverses   itself, the opposition ranks will swell before the next presidential   election in March.  Yet as Orlova pointed out, the Russian   budget has more pressing questions than even social spending. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a   huge believer in this argument,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If we look at the Russian   budget that was recently passed, then social spending only amounts to a   small amount, around ten percent. In comparison to defense spending,   that amount is really quite small.&#8221; Defense spending was the   primary bone of contention when former Russian Finance Minister Alexei   Kudrin was fired by President Dmitri Medvedev in late September. For   many, Kudrin was seen as one of the few voices calling for fiscal   restraint in the government. In 2008, when Russia faced the first round   of the global crisis, Kudrin was the architect of the country&#8217;s   stability fund, which was saved up from the receipts on oil and gas and   helped Russia weather the storm. Today, that emergency fund is   severely reduced and the Russian government relies on oil prices at   close to $120 to break even, up from nearly half that in 2008. Yet what   really worries economists, noted Tchkarov, is that Kudrin&#8217;s absence   means that in the case of a real financial meltdown in Europe, there is   no strong voice for economic policy in Moscow. &#8220;There is not one person   that I really can say is dictating Russian economic policy at this   point, and I think that is one of the things that is giving a lot of   economists cause for concern now,&#8221; he said.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe numbers of Muscovites who have  registered on Facebook to attend this weekend\u0027s demonstrations have swelled  to 30,000 in  the last few days. The Russian blogosphere is alive with messages and calls to  friends to attend, and it is likely the numbers will continue to grow. As the  calls to protest grow, Russian financial analysts have begun issuing notes  analyzing how the political situation will affect Russian business, and the RTS  has sold off sharply. \"We believe that the market is only  now starting to price in the return of top-level political risk for the first  time in 12 years, and that developments in Russia will lead to more short-term  downside,\" said Kingsmill Bond from Citi. He goes on to say that protests are likely to continue  as \"Russia  is unusually well-educated and wealthy to endure a system characterized by so much  corruption. Now that the spark has caught the tinder of discontent, we expect  more protests,\" Bond wrote. Other analysts warn that if the protests this  weekend turn violent, then things could get out of hand. Has Russia reached  a tipping point that will either end in mass violence and repression by the  state or oust Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his clan from the Kremlin? Renaissance\u0027s Charlie Robertson argued earlier this  year that authoritarian societies with per capita income over $6,000 are increasingly  prone to revolutions, and with per capita incomes of  $15,000, Russia is well  beyond this point. However, Robertson made a caveat that oil producers are the  exception to the rule, as their governments have  money to placate the people. Nevertheless the dissatisfaction with Putin\u0027s regime  has clearly been growing over the last year and has become increasingly more  public, culminating recently with Putin being booed in public at a wrestling  match &#8211; the first time he has been criticized in public since the Kursk submarine sank at  the start of his first term in office. This weekend\u0027s demonstrations could prove key. The  opposition is trying to reach critical mass, so how the Kremlin deals with the  crowds in front of the Bolshoi Theatre will have far reaching consequences. Until  now,  average Russians have been unhappy,  but not angry, so they have been unwilling to put themselves in harm\u0027s way. However,  if there is violence, then the public outrage likely to follow could  radicalize the people. Once that happens, as was seen in Kyiv in 2006, there is  no getting the genie back in the bottle. This demonstration has also come a little early for the  Kremlin. As part of the campaign to reinstall Putin as president in the March  elections, the state is likely to ramp up spending to buy off dissent.  Moreover, following United Russia\u0027s poor showing in the Duma elections last  week, the program is likely to be even more aggressive. But this new campaign  has not started and probably won\u0027t start until the middle of January, after the  winter holidays. The Kremlin will need to act faster, and even then it is not  certain such a plan will work unless it can effectively disuse the frustration. Will there be violence? It would be pretty easy to  organize, as if the crowd tries to move beyond the patch of street that has  been sanctioned for the protest the police are almost certain to oppose them.  This is what happened in the protests earlier this week. At the same time,  United Russia and the Kremlin youth group Nashi have also proven themselves  capable of mobilizing several thousand demonstrators when needed. But while the  police can arrest several hundred protestors they can\u0027t arrest several thousand,  and if the numbers that turn out really are this big then it could get ugly.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eA Financial Times survey  of top executives at European companies has shown that European businesses are  already preparing for the collapse of the euro and thus the Eurozone. Concerns  that politicians won&#8217;t be able to prevent the sovereign debt crisis from  dismantling the currency have forced many businesses to establish protection  strategies. However, many Russian  businessmen are hoping for the best. Alexander Arutyunov, a board member of  travel firm Thomas Cook/Intourist, emphasized that contracts for the next six  months have been signed in the euro and no revisions are planned. &#8220;Even if some country  leaves the Eurozone, how can we revise the price if we don&#8217;t know the exchange  rate, which will only be known at the end [of the collapse of the Eurozone]?&#8221;  Arutyunov said. Other businessmen working  in Russia agree. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in the pessimistic scenario; the euro will  remain,&#8221; said Mark Kaufman, co-owner of the Polish alcohol holding CEDC, which  distributes vodka brands such as Zhuravli and Marusya. And even if the euro does collapse, Russian businesses will find  a way to manage, according to Anatoly Korneyev, CEO of wine importer Simple. &#8220;If there won&#8217;t be a  euro, there will be national currencies, and that won&#8217;t significantly affect  the industry,&#8221; he said, adding that for the wine industry, there are minimal  risks.  But Ivan Charakov of  Renaissance Capital said that the unwillingness of some Russian companies to at  least consider the possibility of a euro collapse and plan for its demise puts  Russian holdings at a disadvantage. &#8220;Businesses need to calculate all risks,  even unlikely ones, especially given Russia&#8217;s strong ties to Europe and that  the EU is Russia&#8217;s largest trading partner,&#8221; Charakov said. Export-oriented  industries will be the most affected, said Chakarov, and raw materials will be  affected a little later since the prices for oil, gas and metals are tied to  the U.S. dollar.  &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that  someone still has confidence in the Euro,&#8221; said Oleg Deripaska recently,  expressing concern about the revenue of his giant aluminum holding company  RusAl, which exports primarily to Europe. Deripaska called the collapse of the  euro the main problem in his business empire. In his view, the depreciation of  the euro will reduce the competitiveness of Russian industry.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eMikhail Overchenko, Igor Tsukanov, Tatiana Romanova, Elizaveta Nikitina,  Inna Kravchenko, Ekaterina Sobol, and Kseniya Dokukina all contributed to this  article.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The group also operates Mail.Ru, Russia&#8217;s leading   Internet portal and e-mail service, as well as Mail.Ru Agent and ICQ,   the two largest IM networks in Russia, the latter acquired from AOL in   2010. The holding also owns a range of online games and e-commerce sites   and has a 21.35% stake in payment terminal operator Qiwi. In 2010,   Mail.ru Group&#8217;s gross revenues amounted to $324 million.After spinning   off from investment fund DST, Mail.ru Group successfully began trading   on the London Stock Exchange in October 2010. It kept a fraction of   DST&#8217;s stakes in international sites, including a 2.4% stake in Facebook. Former Mail.ru Group Executive Vice President Global Operations Fran&#231;ois Esculier has gained a seat on the Board of Directors of luxury private shopping club CollectionPrivee.ru. He recently shared with East-West Digital News his vision of the global integration of the Russian Internet, speaking his mind on the management issues domestic players faced as well as about online strategies for international brands in Russia.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow  did a Frenchman become VP of a leading Russian Internet group?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eI have  worked in Russia  for some time. Before moving to the Internet industry, I managed luxury and  FMCG companies like Richmont Luxury Group and chocolate maker A. Korkunov. I met  Yuri Milner, the co-founder of DST which later spawned Mail.ru Group, through  an investment banker who involved in Korkunov&#8217;s deal with Wrigley in 2007. At that  time, Yuri&#8217;s team consisted mainly of geeks lacking corporate management  skills. He asked if I was interested in getting involved in developing the  organization and I became Executive VP working with Dmitry Grishin, the group&#8217;s  CEO. I was mainly in charge of the financial and commercial aspects, including  monetization.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSwitching  from chocolate to online advertising?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRapid growth creates organizational challenges that are largely similar in both FMCG  and Internet industries. Many Internet companies in Russia have a top down  organizational structure. They should consider matrix management with project  oriented cross functional work groups instead and integrate control procedures  rather than hierarchical chain of approval. In traditional top down hierarchies, managers at each level tend to manage their  boss rather than their clients. These vertical structures usually stand in  opposition to customer oriented organizational structures we are accustomed to  seeing in FMCG companies. Not only that. Maxtrix management structures offer better conditions for creativity,  which is key in the Internet industry.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDo  you think the Russian Internet industry lacks creativity?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eMost  Russian projects have been developed as copy cats of successful foreign models,  for example Vkontakte.ru, Russia&#8217;s leading social network launched in 2006,  which is basically a Facebook clone\u003c/t\u003e\u003ci\u003e.\u003c/i\u003e\u003ct\u003eThere  have been very few original product offerings on the Russian market, despite  the advanced level and potential of Russian engineers. Mediocre  creativity also reflects a lack of cultural diversity. In Silicon   Valley, 70% or 80% of the great success stories come from people  raised in a multicultural environment, like Steve Jobs who had a Syrian father  or Sergey Brin who came from a Russian family. Foreign  talent is far and few between in Russian middle management. In top management,  we can see some foreigners who have created strong Internet companies, like  Kupivip.ru founder Oskar Hartmann and Fast Lane Ventures founder Pascal  Cl&#233;ment, not to mention a growing number of Russians with solid international  experience.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow  do you see the Russian Internet positioned in terms of its integration with the  global digital economy?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe Russian  market has a number of specific characteristics, the weak presence of global  players not the least. Russia  and China  are the only large countries where Facebook and Google are not leaders. Twitter  and Foursquare launched their Russian versions just months ago. Amazon doesn&#8217;t  even have one, although it does brisk sales to Russian customers. At the same  time, there is a pitched global battle going on for digital leadership &#8211; it&#8217;s  an open question weather social networks, search engines or mail platforms will  dominate tomorrow&#8217;s web.  This battle is raging in Russia as well  along the same fronts, but between local titans Yandex, Vkontakte and Mail.ru.  In Russia, as elsewhere, its almost certain than pure email players will  disappear in the next 5 to 10 years as more and more messaging is being done on  social networks, for instance. This is why integrating Vkontakte within Mail.ru  Group is so strategic. They&#8217;re already a minority stakeholder, but the group  has repeatedly expressed its interest in  taking full control\u003c/t\u003e\u003ci\u003e \u003c/i\u003e\u003ct\u003eof  Vkontakte and it&#8217;s not hard to see why. In this  context, some Russian players are visionaries. Not only have DST and Mail.ru  Group assembled social networks, mail services and a variety of other key  assets in their international portfolio. Yuri Milner is one of the rare figures  who really understands the Internet as a global village. DST has prepared  itself to fully leverage technological and human exchanges on a global scale,  maximizing creativity and cultural diversity. If the group manages to address  this vision at management level, this strength will soon become obvious with  more and more group executives moving between Russia,  the US, China, where DST is developing  fast. We can  observe, by contrast, how many key Western players remain fixated with Western  markets, coming to Russia  and China  late in the game anemic with copy paste schemes.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCan  you tell us how luxury brands are faring on the Russian Internet  and the story behind your new position on the Board of Advisors at  CollectionPrivee.ru?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eIn Russia  as elsewhere, luxury brands need the Internet to increase their sales volumes. In  some cases, online channels work very well, as witnessed by the success of  VentesPrivees.com in France  or, more recently, the acquisition of Netaporter by Richemont. In other cases,  the marriage of luxury brands and the Internet doesn&#8217;t work, or at least not  yet. Luxury goods are about more than just the purchase experience, but about  the luxury experience. In brick and mortar, you don&#8217;t open a luxury boutique  just next to a hard discounter. On the Internet, you don&#8217;t mix your brand with  brands in a lower segment, you have to guarantee timely delivery, luxury  packaging, and so on. It&#8217;s often harder to create a distinctive luxury  experience online because of the leveling effect Internet marketing has. Another  challenge is piracy, which is the rule rather than the exception with many  Russian sites offering luxury goods. This issue could be addressed more  efficiently with Russia&#8217;s  participation in WTO. Having said  all this, a number of luxury brands are now going online successfully in Russia.  CollectionPrivee appealed to me as the best platform to address the needs of  luxury brands on the Russian Internet because its approach offers a subtle  balance between quantity and quality, brand image and sales volumes. As a  consequence of operating in these parameters, the site has built very strong  relationships with brands and enjoys long term client loyalty and trust.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eA  Frenchman living in Russia  since 1993, \u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003eFran&#231;ois Esculier\u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003e has  worked at numerous international companies.

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eAs  if tax relief isn\u0027t alluring enough, the government\u0027s Special Economic  Zones now offers new services to net international firms. Investors  no longer have to build their own facilities, but can ask Special Economic  Zones to do it for them, said chief executive Oleg Kostin in an  interview. The investor then rents the space. Special  Economic Zones, which is the state company managing 24 dedicated locations  around the country, offers the opportunity to remove  the risk for investors of wasting construction costs if  the business doesn\u0027t take off &#8212; and spare them the hassle  of operating the building, he said. \"Sometimes,  they say it is a standard practice for them in any country  around the world,\" Kostin said about the renting option.  \"For us, it\u0027s a chance to attract a large company.\" Nokia  Siemens Networks said the rental proposal was essential for its  Russian joint venture in selecting the Tomsk zone to set up  a plant. Nokia Siemens Networks has a policy to avoid ownership  of real estate, chief executive for Russia, Kristina Tikhonova, said  through an aide. The joint  venture, where the foreign company is majority owner, will produce  telecoms equipment at the plant that opened last week, just months after  the partners signed a tentative agreement in March to work  together. The rental  revenues could pay for construction within eight years, Kostin said. Built  to standard design, the facilities could still be good for other  potential companies if the original producer pulls out of the zone. Special  Economic Zones offers the ready-made rental option in four zones  where investors expressed interest: Tomsk, St. Petersburg, Alabuga  in Tatarstan and Zelenograd, a town outside Moscow that\u0027s  formally a district of the city. A Russian  or foreign company, if it qualifies as a \"resident\" of a  special economic zone, can save up to 30 percent of the cost  of setting up a production unit through tax relief, customs benefits  and immediate access to utilities. A council  run by the Economic Development Ministry, made up of its officials  and top executives from state-controlled banks and state  corporations like Russian Technologies, holds the ultimate power  to admit companies as residents of Russia\u0027s 24 zones if they meet  conditions that include the application of advanced technology  and potential to make products that replace imports or are suitable  for export. Since  the inception of special economic zones in 2006, the effort  has drawn 272 businesses whose declared total investment stands at 308  billion rubles, or $9.9 billion. They  are mostly Russian companies, but include such multinational corporations as Japanese tire  maker Yokohama Rubber, French industrial gases producer Air Liquide, Danish  construction materials manufacturer Rockwool, Swiss drugs company Novartis  and the U.S. flexible display developer Plastic Logic. Foreigners  did inspire the new rent-a-plant proposal, but they generally don\u0027t get  special treatment at Special Economic Zones, said Kostin,  a 36-year-old former investment official at the Economic Development  Ministry who assumed his new position in March. Russian residents prevail  at the moment because they are better aware of the opportunity,  Kostin said. In order to reach out to overseas companies,  Special Economic Zones is promoting itself through large international  consulting firms and subscribed to a Financial Times service that  alerts users to corporate announcements about Russia. \"We  hope that we will have many foreign companies, too,\" he said. Investors  won\u0027t find greater benefits anywhere else in Russia, Kostin said.  Governors may offer some similar tax incentives, but unlike Special Economic  Zones, they have no power to cancel customs duties and lack  the federal financial prowess to build electricity and heating  lines and create other services on sites, he said.  The government has spent more than 45 billion rubles to develop  the zones so far. For the  four zones that specialize in research and development,  the government offers discounted payroll taxes. Every up-and-running  special economic zone also houses offices of various government agencies, should investors need  to contact them quickly. \"We  believe the package of services that we can offer is unique,\"  Kostin said. In fact,  the tax breaks, which last for at least five years, all come  at the expense of regional and local budgets that normally  collect the taxes on land, vehicles and corporate property. The profit  tax, which is normally 20 percent, is reduced to 15.5 percent  for zone residents &#8212; but the cut comes at the expense  of the regional budget. The federal government will still get its  full 2 percent portion. Governors  can also slash the regional slice of the profit tax by 4 percent  and reduce the corporate property tax, said Pavel Vasin,  a Moscow-based associate at German law firm CMS. But they provide  such incentives only if they view the investment as significant &#8212;  a notion that varies from region to region, he said. In the  Moscow region, home to two research and development special economic  zones, the authorities grant profit tax relief if an investor invests  upward of 500 million rubles. A lower property tax comes  into play if property value rises above 300 million rubles. Industrial  zones require investors to cough up at least 3 million euros (125  million rubles), while port zones look for 10 million euros or more. But  potential investors may opt to set up business elsewhere in Russia  anyway if the consideration of being closer to their customers  or suppliers outweighs the benefits of the zones, Vasin said. \"There  are geographical preferences,\" he said. \"An investor &#8230; may base his decision  on logistical rather than fiscal advantages.\"  Air  Liquide had nothing but accolades for the Alabuga industrial zone where  the company launched the first phase of its 35 million euro  plant last year. \"We  are very happy,\" said Dmitry Kuznetsov, director for strategic  projects at the company\u0027s Russian office. \"Everything they have  on paper materializes in life. \"It\u0027s  not one of those initiatives that occasionally declare one thing  and result in something else.\" Air  Liquide &#8212; which sells its gaseous oxygen a German-Russian fiberglass  producer that is a neighbor in the Alabuga zone &#8212; especially  valued the opportunity to connect to the electricity supply free  of charge, Kuznetsov said. Outside  the zones, the price tag for this hook-up could be hundreds  of millions of rubles ($3 million to $16 million)  in industrial regions, where Air Liquide typically seeks to locate  its energy-intensive plants to be close to customers, he said. Exemptions  from the customs duties and the value-added tax on imports  reduced the costs of components imported to build  the plant, he said. Next  year may see a boost in the development of special economic  zones in ports and airports because of pending legislative  changes, Kostin said. Among other things, the changes, in effect  from Jan. 1, will allow setting up production in these zones, whereas  now businesses registered there can only provide services.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSpecial Economic Zones Cater to Tourists, Too\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThirteen  of the country\u0027s 24 special economic zones are vehicles to develop  tourism. They are mostly in southern and eastern Russia. One  of their most expensive projects is a brainchild of Pyotr Shura,  whose company Rusresorts wants to build a $1 billion resort near Lake  Baikal, as part of the far eastern cluster of tourism zones. Upmarket  resorts in clean and picturesque areas in the east could draw  tourists from China and invite stopovers by Russians traveling  from the west to warm-weather destinations like Vietnam  and Thailand, said Oleg Kostin, chief of Special Economic Zones. The other  cluster of tourist special economic zones seeks to turn  the restive Russian Caucasus into a magnet for vacationers.  Special Economic Zones partnered two other state-controlled institutions,  lenders Sberbank and VEB, to create a company, called North  Caucasus Resorts, that aims to develop and operate six areas  in the Caucasus.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirst published in \"The Moscow Times\" daily.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"Author": "Vladimir Tikhomirov, Ogonyok magazine",
				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe owners of Galen - creator  and inventor-in-chief Valery Nikolaev and his older son Yevgeny, the commercial  director - recently spoke to &#8220;Ogonyok&#8221; magazine about how their unique  enterprise came into being and the prospects for using composite building  materials in Russia.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYevgeny Nikolaev\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003e  - On  the advice of some builders we knew, we decided to begin developing and  producing composite fixtures for civil and industrial construction. At the time,  our construction industry was instituting new requirements for energy  efficiency, according to which all concrete walls had to consist of three  layers &#8212; an outer wall, an inner wall and in between the two a layer of thermal  insulation. New approaches to joining the layers of this &#8220;sandwich&#8221; were needed,  and my father suggested using composite materials instead of the standard steel  fittings. He ended by developing an entire production cycle. First, we twist  synthetic materials into rope and then introduce into those structures  nano-particles of clay in a special heat chamber. The result is a light and  very sturdy rod that can be cut up into the necessary components. It all sounds  very simple, but no one else in the world had managed to come up with this  technology.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eValery Nikolaev\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003e  - Do  you know what &#8220;little heat bridges&#8221; are? If you conduct a thermal-vision survey  of the fa&#231;ade of any concrete-slab building you will see scattered here and  there against the background of the cold violet walls hot orange points &#8212; these  are the places where the steel fittings are located and through which the heat  escapes from our apartments. Using composite fittings allows you to get rid of  those &#8220;little heat bridges&#8221; and cut heat loss by 30-40 percent. Today few people  remember that in the 1960s, the Soviet Union adopted a government program to  decrease metal dependence. This led to the first experiments in producing and  using composites made from polymers combined with basalt rock. This program was  also of significance in space &#8212; after the launch of the Soviet lunar modules,  our scientists developed construction projects for a Soviet base on the Moon. Guess  what construction material they used?\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYevgeny Nikolaev\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003e  - More than 30 percent of  what we produce is exported abroad &#8212; to the UK, to the Middle East and to North  Africa. Our building materials are especially popular in Britain, where a  program to build energy-efficient housing is in place. In addition, our  nano-structured materials have been used to build a section of the  transnational Europe-Western China highway in Tatarstan, a bridge in the UK,  and mines in the Kuzbass coal basin. We worked around the clock for three years  straight to become a Rosnano rated organization &#8212; that is a highly respected title  that gives us a green light to cooperate with all Russian state corporations.  This is very important, because the future belongs to composites. Russia  produces 400 grams of composites per person a year. China produces around a  kilogram, and the United States over 8 kilos. Steel and aluminum are materials  that belong to the last century, even today&#8217;s airplanes are made almost  entirely (90 percent) of composite materials.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eValery Nikolaev\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ct\u003e  - We are developing  production not only in Russia, but in other countries, for example, India. We  try to maintain a flexible approach because to produce goods in Russia is not  always profitable, and in certain cases it&#8217;s downright unprofitable. Our Indian  partners can &#8211; according to Indian sanitary norms &#8211; use chemicals that are  strictly forbidden in Russia. Therefore it&#8217;s simpler to produce many components  in India for the Indian market. To be honest, the production of basalt-plastic  building structures no longer interests me very much. I&#8217;ve already thought up,  created and set all that in motion. Now it&#8217;s the turn of my sons to take it  further. I&#8217;m interested in new directions &#8212; for instance, the use of composites  in road works, in power engineering and even in space.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eRussian powerhouse search engine, Yandex, has bought  SPB Software, a developer of software for mobile devices and carriers. According  to sources, Yandex paid around $38 million for the acquisition of the company. The  Vice President of SPB Software, Olga Steidl, confirmed that the company\u0027s  founder &#8211; Sebastian-Justus Schmidt, Vasily Filippov, and Yaroslav Goncharov &#8211;  will be working at Yandex. SPB Software develops applications for the Android,  iOS, Windows, Blackberry, WebOS, Maemo and Bada mobile platforms. In addition,  the company is known as the creator of the SPB Shell 3-D, which is a  three-dimensional interface for smartphones and tablets. Yandex has been open  about the fact that this application is the most interesting SPB Software  product for the search engine. &#8220;We need it to significantly increase our mobile  presence,&#8221; Yandex General Director Arkady Volozh said. Now, Yandex will be able  to provide vendors with an important component to any mobile platform: an  interface that includes access to key services. Analysts at Western investment banks have repeatedly  reproached Yandex for not having a clear mobile device strategy. They have  advised Yandex to create its own operating system and to even release a Yandex  smartphone. Although still dominant, Yandex has begun to lose ground in the  Russian Internet search engine market due to the growing popularity of  competitor interfaces like the Android OS and Google&#8217;s Chrome browser.  The purchase of SPB Software does not mean that Yandex  will develop its own operating system for smartphones, a Yandex representative  said, but it &#8220;gives us the opportunity to do so, if needed.&#8221; Through the deal,  Yandex will become the developer of the shell application for mobile operating  systems, he added. Yandex&#8217;s goal to create its own operating system using  SPB Software alone is not enough, noted Eldar Murtazin, a leading analyst at  Mobile Research Group. Mobile technology expert Alex Patsay, former business  director for application developer Unreal Mojo, said that Yandex appears to be  planning to release a smartphone that incorporates the SPB Software as an  interface shell. Until Yandex has an OS for mobile devices, the company  can &#8220;impose&#8221; any shell it wants. For example, it can use OS Android, because  Android source code is distributed free of charge and Google does not regulate  developers&#8217; use of the OS if it doesn&#8217;t use Google services, Patsay added. Yandex  already uses a product that is based on the browser Chromium, which was built  by its rival, Google. According to Patsay, further development of an Android  smartphone that uses the SPB shell could cost   between $50-100 million. What\u0027s more, creating an entirely new operating  system capable of competing with Android could cost anywhere from $100-200  million, Murtazin added. Currently, Android represents more than half of the  total market share for smartphone operating systems, with most major  manufacturers producing their phones using the OS. Until recently, Nokia was  releasing phones that operated on its own platform, Symbian, but the company  has switched to Windows Phone 7 for its new devices. The third major player is  Apple, with its iOS. Yandex may very well promote its operating system in local  markets, where its services are already popular, Murtazin said. However, the  big question that remains is whether room actually exists in the market for a  Yandex-based operating system.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirst published on Vedomosti.ru\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eA Russian research  engineer has designed a radiation dosimeter that can be integrated with mobile  phones or added as an application. The trial version of the \u0027DO-RA\u0027 mobile  application (the name is an acronym of dosimeter-radiometer) is already  available on the App Store and Android Market. After the Fukushima  radiation leak, Vladimir Yelin, 54, who is head of the company Smart Logistic  Group, was asked to write an opinion piece about the incident. This gave him the idea for the device. The \u0027DO-RA\u0027 mobile application operates in four different modes. It can work as a  radiometer which can display a radiation map of a given area, such as a  reservoir or area of land, on a mobile phone or a tablet screen. It has three levels of  alert: normal (green zone), high-risk (amber zone,) and an urgent evacuation  warning (red zone.) It can superimpose the map onto a downloadable world map on  the screen and owners can add their GPS/Glonass measurements to it. The  dosimeter function displays the radiation level absorbed by the holder. In the  event of exposure to a critical dose, the DO-RA alerts its holder with audio  and visual signals. Finally, in another mode, the phone can provide relevant information on  potential risks for different organs of the body associated with the absorbed  radiation levels. Users or their doctors can then access the data from anywhere  in the world.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe very process of creating the device wasn&#8217;t smooth. &#8220;At the initial stage,  assembling a team of developers was tricky; it took at least one-and-a-half to  two months to find them. I stumbled upon a worthy team by pure luck&#8221;, recalls  Mr Yelin. Another problem was obtaining finance. &#8220;Very few Russian banks are prepared to  lend money for such projects. Venture funds that specialise in financing new  businesses are only testing the waters in the huge Russian market. Most don\u0027t  like to risk their capital on inventions,&#8221; says the inventor. Mr Yelin decided to try his luck with the Skolkovo Innovation Centre, the  much-discussed Russian Silicon Valley-in-the-making. He used Skolkovo&#8217;s website  to create a resume and a roadmap for the project, including a detailed  description of its research and development components and a business plan.  After an assessment by a panel of 10 industry experts, Mr Yelin obtained the  board&#8217;s assent on the project&#8217;s compliance with Skolkovo requirements. &#8220;I have  become a fully fledged participant in Russia&#8217;s innovation process,  entitled to Skolkovo&#8217;s unique benefits,&#8221; he says.  &#8220;As a Skolkovo resident, OAO Intersoft Eurasia, the operator of the DO-RA  project, will pay only 14pc payroll tax. We will be exempt from all other  taxes. One can only qualify for such exemptions under the Russian tax system by  conducting R&D work as part of proprietary innovation projects with the  subsequent commercialisation of the invention.&#8221;  According to Mr Yelin, the  price of the device to be integrated into the mobile phone will be around  $30-$50, but if the device is to be integrated into the phone in the production  process at the factory, the cost can be cut to $10.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

				"ContentData": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003eThe creation of the Common Economic Space  (CES) has begun. On November 18, the presidents of Russia,  Belarus and Kazakhstan  signed an agreement for the establishment of a central integration body for the  three countries, the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC). The EEC will replace the Customs Union Commission, which will cease to exist on July 1,  2012, and will be a supranational body for governing the integration effort.  The commission is due to start work on January 1, 2012. The Kremlin has said  that the EEC will be &#8220;a management body for integration processes in the format  of the Customs Union and the CES.&#8221;  The structure of the EEC is similar to the European Union, with its European  Council and European Commission. The EEC will have two tiers. The upper tier,  its council, will include the deputy prime ministers of the three countries,  with First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov representing Russia. The  lower level, the board, will be the EEC&#8217;s main working body, with  decision-making powers over customs duties as well as sanitary, veterinary, and  immigration control. It will also oversee the allocation of industrial and  agricultural subsidies. Viktor    Khristenko, Russia&#8217;s  industry minister, is the appointed head of the EEC. &#8220;We have taken a new and very powerful step on the path to forming a Eurasian  Economic Union (EEU), an alliance which will undoubtedly determine the future  of our countries,&#8221; President Medvedev said, adding that the agreement allows  the three countries to establish the CES and then the EEU, possibly before  2015. The EEC leaders are keen to avoid the mistakes of the European Union. The  Russian president believes that the EEU will avoid the problems of the eurozone  because its members, &#8220;starting out from a more or less level economic playing  field&#8221;, share common history and have rapidly growing economies &#8211; meaning they  are less likely to become a fragmented conglomerate. Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakhstan  president, said &#8220;the union of three&#8221; will become &#8220;the most powerful&#8221; alliance,  with &#8220;the combined GDP of the three countries approaching $2trn.&#8221;  Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarus  president, assured the audience at the signing that &#8220;these documents will be  ratified as soon as possible and will go into law in our country.&#8221; Experts see  the EEC&#8217;s establishment as an extremely important development and a triumph for  Russia, as well as for its  partners in the commission, Belarus  and Kazakhstan.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ct\u003ePolitical analyst Sergei Markov said: &#8220;The signing is a very important step  forward and an extraordinary success.&#8221; He believes it is part of a new trend  towards integration, which is important in light of the threat of a new  economic crisis, as it will help all three countries greatly reduce its  possible impact. &#8220;We will have more opportunities to combat the crisis by relying on our  domestic market,&#8221; he said. An analysis of existing economic trends in the post-Soviet space shows that the  business communities of all three countries have already been actively  implementing integration plans. &#8220;The main advantage for our countries&#8217;  companies is the elimination of customs barriers, which will not only lead to  direct savings on customs fees, but also to indirect benefits from the removal  of bureaucratic obstacles, and accelerate trade between the member countries of  the future union,&#8221; said Aleksandra Lozovaya, the head of research at Vector Securities, an investment company. For example, the Russian company Eurochem plans to invest $2bn in a large-scale  project it is actively pursuing in Kazakhstan. The project involves  developing phosphate deposits in the Karatau  Basin in southern Kazakhstan, and building a mining and processing  plant in the city of Zhanatas,  as well as production plants for phosphate, nitrogen, and mixed fertilisers in  Karatau with a combined capacity of more than one million tons annually. In another example of business integration, Lukoil is successfully operating in  Kazakhstan and Belarus. Kazakhstan  projects make up 40pc of the largest Russian oil company&#8217;s overseas reserves.  In addition, more than half of its investments in foreign upstream projects are  in Kazakhstan. This autumn, ZAO Atomstroyexport (SC Rosatom) and SA Nuclear Power Plant  Construction Directorate (Belarus)  signed a contractual agreement to build Belarus&#8217;s first nuclear power  plant. It will be built in Astraviec in the Grodno region, where preparatory work has  already begun. Belarus  will thus acquire a reliable and stable source of energy, which will to some  extent help it solve its power supply problems. According to Lukoil&#8217;s CEO,  Vagit Alekperov, one of the main tasks of the governments and the business  community, as part of the integration process is to harmonise legislation, and  to lift national as well as international legal and administrative barriers.\u003c/t\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",
